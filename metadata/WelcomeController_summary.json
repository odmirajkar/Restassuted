  "file_summary": "This Java class, `WelcomeController`, is a Spring `@Controller` component within the PetClinic application. Its sole responsibility is to handle the application's root URL. Specifically, it defines a `@GetMapping(\"/\")` annotation, meaning that when a user accesses the base URL of the application, the `welcome()` method is invoked. This method simply returns the string \"welcome\", which Spring MVC then resolves to a corresponding view (e.g., a Thymeleaf or JSP template named `welcome.html` or `welcome.jsp`). This class serves as the entry point for the web application, directing users to the initial welcome page, which typically provides an overview or starting point for navigating the PetClinic features.",
