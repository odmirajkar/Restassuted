  "file_summary": "This Java class, `WelcomeController`, is a simple Spring MVC controller within the PetClinic application. Annotated with `@Controller`, it is designed to handle web requests and render views. Its primary function is to serve as the application's entry point or home page.\n\nThe `welcome()` method is mapped to the root URL (`/`) using the `@GetMapping` annotation. When a user navigates to the application's base URL, this method is invoked, and it simply returns the string \"welcome\". This string is then resolved by Spring MVC's view resolver mechanism to display the corresponding `welcome` view (e.g., `welcome.html` or `welcome.jsp`), effectively presenting the initial landing page of the PetClinic application.",
