  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the `WelcomeController` class, which is a core component in the Spring PetClinic application's system module. Annotated with `@Controller`, it serves as a Spring MVC controller responsible for handling web requests. Its primary purpose is to manage the application's home or welcome page. Specifically, it contains a single method, `welcome()`, that is mapped to the root URL (\"/\") using the `@GetMapping` annotation. When a user accesses the application's base URL, this controller will return the logical view name \"welcome\", which typically resolves to a Thymeleaf or JSP template displaying the application's entry page. This controller exemplifies a simple, direct mapping for a landing page in a Spring Boot application.",
