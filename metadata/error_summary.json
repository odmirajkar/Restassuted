It is designed to be a replacement for the `fragments/layout` template, specifically for displaying error-related content. The page includes a descriptive heading \"Something happened...\" (localized via Thymeleaf's `#{somethingHappened}`), an image (likely a mascot or logo), and a placeholder paragraph to display the actual exception message (`${message}`). Its main purpose is to provide a user-friendly and consistent error display to the end-user, inheriting the overall layout from a common fragment.",
