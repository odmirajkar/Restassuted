  "file_summary": "This HTML file serves as a generic error page within a Spring Boot application using Thymeleaf. It extends a common layout fragment ('fragments/layout') and is designed to display an error message to the user. The page includes an image (presumably a pet-related graphic) and uses Thymeleaf expressions to dynamically display a localized heading ('Something happened...') and the specific exception message passed to it. It's a foundational template for user-friendly error handling, providing a consistent look and feel across the application's error displays.",
