It uses Thymeleaf's layout capabilities to integrate into a common page structure defined in `fragments/layout.html`. The page displays a generic error message like 'Something happened...' and also presents a dynamic exception message passed from the server. An image related to 'pets' is also displayed, likely a static resource, to enhance the user experience during an error. It's designed to provide user-friendly feedback when an unexpected issue occurs.",
