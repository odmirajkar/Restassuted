It integrates with a common layout fragment, 'fragments/layout', and is configured to present an 'error' theme. The page includes an image (likely a 'pets.png' image) to enhance the visual appeal, followed by a prominent heading indicating that 'Something happened...'. Crucially, it dynamically displays an exception message passed to it, providing specific details about the error. This template ensures a consistent look and feel for error pages across the application, leveraging Thymeleaf's templating capabilities to inject dynamic content like messages and resource paths.",
