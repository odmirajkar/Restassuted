  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, specifically tailored for internationalization (i18n) to provide Korean (ko) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It serves as a resource bundle, mapping various keys to their corresponding Korean translations. These translations are used extensively throughout the application's user interface for labels, form field names, button texts, navigation links, and validation messages. The content clearly indicates its purpose within a 'PetClinic :: Spring Framework 데모' (PetClinic :: Spring Framework Demo) context, as seen in the 'layoutTitle' entry. It covers a wide range of application-specific terms related to '소유자' (Owner), '반려동물' (Pets), '수의사' (Veterinarians), and '방문' (Visits), along with common form attributes such as '이름' (First Name), '성' (Last Name), '주소' (Address), and '전화번호' (Telephone). Furthermore, it includes crucial action-oriented labels like '소유자 추가' (Add Owner), '반려동물 수정' (Edit Pet), and '방문 추가' (Add Visit), as well as common error and validation messages like '입력이 필요합니다' (required) and '잘못된 날짜입니다' (invalid date). This file is essential for delivering a fully localized user experience in Korean for the application.",
