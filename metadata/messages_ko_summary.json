  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, commonly used in Java applications for externalizing and localizing user interface text, messages, and labels. Specifically, this file contains the Korean (ko) translations for the PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to enable internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to display its content in Korean when the user's locale is set accordingly. The file comprises a collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a corresponding Korean string. The content covers a wide array of application messages, including general welcome and error messages like \"환영합니다\" (Welcome) and \"오류\" (Error), as well as validation messages such as \"입력이 필요합니다\" (required), \"잘못된 날짜입니다\" (invalid date), and \"전화번호는 10자리 숫자여야 합니다\" (Telephone must be a 10-digit number). It also defines labels for various entities and their attributes within the application, such as \"소유자\" (Owner), \"반려동물\" (Pet), \"이름\" (Name), \"주소\" (Address), and \"생년월일\" (Birth Date). Furthermore, it provides Korean labels for navigation elements and actions, including \"소유자 추가\" (Add Owner), \"소유자 찾기\" (Find Owner), \"반려동물 수정\" (Edit Pet), \"홈\" (Home), and pagination terms like \"첫 번째\" (First) and \"다음\" (Next). This file is essential for providing a fully localized user experience for Korean-speaking users of the application.",
