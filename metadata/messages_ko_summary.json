  "file_summary": "This file is a localization resource, specifically for the Korean language, within a PetClinic application. It contains a collection of key-value pairs where keys are identifiers used in the application's code and values are the corresponding Korean translations for user interface labels, messages, and navigation elements. Its primary purpose is to enable the PetClinic application to display text in Korean, catering to users who prefer this language. The file includes translations for common UI components such as form labels (e.g., 'firstName' mapped to '이름', 'address' to '주소'), navigation links (e.g., 'addOwner' to '소유자 추가'), various error and validation messages (e.g., 'required' to '입력이 필요합니다', 'duplicateFormSubmission' to '중복 제출은 허용되지 않습니다'), and labels pertinent to pets and their visits (e.g., 'birthDate' to '생년월일', 'previousVisits' to '이전 방문'). By centralizing these strings, the application can be easily adapted for international audiences without modifying the core code, promoting maintainability and reusability of text elements across the application's user interface."
