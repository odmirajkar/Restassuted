  "file_summary": "This XML file is a configuration for Checkstyle's `SuppressionFilter`. Its main purpose is to define rules for ignoring specific files or types of violations during a Checkstyle analysis. It instructs Checkstyle to completely skip all checks for files located within the `node_modules`, `node`, `build`, and `target` directories. These directories typically contain third-party dependencies, build artifacts, or generated code that should not be subject to standard code style checks. Furthermore, the configuration includes a rule to suppress the `NoHttp` check for various common binary and resource file extensions such as `.jar`, `.git`, `.ico`, `.p12`, `.gif`, `.jks`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, and `.log`. This helps in preventing irrelevant warnings on non-source code files, allowing Checkstyle to focus its analysis on the relevant application source code.",
