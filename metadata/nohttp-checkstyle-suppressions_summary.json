  "file_summary": "This XML file defines suppression rules for Checkstyle, a static code analysis tool used in software development. Its primary purpose is to instruct Checkstyle to ignore specific files or patterns when performing code quality checks. The configuration specifies that files within `node_modules`, `node`, `build`, and `target` directories should be completely ignored for all checks. Additionally, it contains a rule to suppress the `NoHttp` check for various binary and resource file types such as `.jar`, `.git`, `.ico`, `.p12`, `.gif`, `.jks`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, and `.log`. This helps in avoiding unnecessary warnings or errors for generated files, third-party libraries, or non-source code assets, ensuring that Checkstyle focuses on the relevant source code.",
