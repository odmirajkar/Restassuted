  "file_summary": "This XML file defines Checkstyle suppression rules, commonly used in Java projects to exclude specific files or directories from code quality checks. It instructs Checkstyle to ignore all violations in `node_modules`, `node`, `build`, and `target` directories, which typically contain third-party libraries or build artifacts. Additionally, it suppresses the `NoHttp` check for various binary or resource file types like `.jar`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, and `.log`, preventing irrelevant violations. This configuration helps streamline code analysis by focusing on actual source code and avoiding noise from auxiliary files or generated content, ensuring a more relevant Checkstyle report.",
