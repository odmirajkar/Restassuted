  "file_summary": "This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named 'Java CI with Gradle'. Its primary purpose is to automate the build process for a Java project using Gradle, enhancing efficiency by caching dependencies. The workflow is triggered on every push and pull request targeting the 'main' branch, ensuring that all code changes are automatically validated. It runs on an Ubuntu-latest environment and is configured to use Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17. The steps involved include checking out the repository code, setting up the specified JDK version (with Maven caching enabled to speed up subsequent runs), configuring Gradle, and finally executing the Gradle build command (`./gradlew build`). This automation is crucial for continuous integration, allowing developers to quickly identify and address build failures and maintain a healthy codebase.",
