  "file_summary": "This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named \"Java CI with Gradle\". Its primary purpose is to automate the building of a Java project using Gradle. The workflow is configured to trigger on `push` and `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch, ensuring that every code change to the main branch is automatically built and validated. The workflow consists of a single job named `build` which executes on `ubuntu-latest` and uses a strategy to build with specified Java versions (currently Java 17). The steps involved include checking out the repository, setting up the specified JDK (with Maven dependency caching for performance), setting up Gradle, and finally executing the `./gradlew build` command to compile the project, run tests, and package the application. This workflow helps maintain code quality and ensures the project is always buildable.",
