  "file_summary": "This XML file serves as a Checkstyle configuration that primarily integrates and configures the `NoHttpCheck`. This custom Checkstyle module is designed to detect and flag occurrences of direct HTTP connections or URLs within the codebase, promoting the use of HTTPS for secure communication. The configuration also includes a `SuppressionFilter` which points to `nohttp-checkstyle-suppressions.xml`, indicating that certain `NoHttp` violations can be suppressed based on rules defined in that separate suppression file. This setup ensures that the `NoHttpCheck` runs as part of the code quality analysis, while also allowing for specific exclusions to manage false positives or known exceptions.",
