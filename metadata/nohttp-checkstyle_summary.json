  "file_summary": "This XML file is a Checkstyle configuration. It defines the rules and modules that Checkstyle will use to enforce coding standards. Specifically, it includes the 'NoHttpCheck' module from 'io.spring.nohttp.checkstyle.check', which is designed to prevent the use of 'http://' URLs (favoring 'https://' or relative paths) within code. It also configures a 'SuppressionFilter' module, which points to 'nohttp-checkstyle-suppressions.xml'. This suppression file is used to ignore or suppress NoHttpCheck warnings for specific lines or files, allowing exceptions to the rule without modifying the core Checkstyle configuration. The overall purpose is to integrate the NoHttp linting rule into a project's build process via Checkstyle.",
