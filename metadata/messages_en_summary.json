  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, typically used in Java applications for storing localized messages and text. However, its content explicitly states that it is intentionally empty. The purpose of an empty `messages_en.properties` file (or any locale-specific properties file) is to ensure that message look-ups for the corresponding locale (in this case, English, indicated by `_en`) will fall back to the default `messages.properties` file. This is a common practice in internationalization (i18n) where the base `messages.properties` file contains the messages for the primary or default language (often English), and locale-specific files are created only when a translation differs from the default. By being empty, this file signals that the English messages are identical to those in the default file, thereby avoiding redundancy and simplifying maintenance.",
