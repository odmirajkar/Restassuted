  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the `CrashController` class, which is a Spring MVC controller. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate exception handling within a web application. It exposes a single endpoint `/oups` that, when accessed, intentionally throws a `RuntimeException`. This allows developers to observe and test how the application's error handling mechanisms (e.g., error pages, exception resolvers) respond to unexpected runtime errors. The controller is a simple example to showcase the error flow, as mentioned in its Javadoc.",
