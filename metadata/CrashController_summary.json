  "file_summary": "This Java file defines a Spring MVC controller named `CrashController`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate Spring's exception handling capabilities within a web application. It exposes a single GET endpoint, `/oups`, which, when accessed, deliberately throws a `RuntimeException`. This allows developers to observe and test how the application (and Spring framework) handles unexpected errors, often redirecting to a generic error page (like \"error.html\" as mentioned in the comments). It's a simple example to showcase error flow and robust exception management in a Spring Boot or Spring MVC application.",
