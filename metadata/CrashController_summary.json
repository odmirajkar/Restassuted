  "file_summary": "This Java class, `CrashController`, is a Spring `@Controller` component within the PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the application's exception handling mechanism. It exposes a single GET endpoint `/oups`. When this endpoint is accessed, the `triggerException()` method is invoked, which intentionally throws a `RuntimeException`. This simulates an unexpected error condition, allowing developers to observe how the application's configured error pages and exception handlers respond. The accompanying documentation also hints at an 'error.html' view, suggesting a standard error page is in place to gracefully handle such unhandled exceptions, providing a better user experience even during system failures.",
