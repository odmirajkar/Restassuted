My purpose is to **summarize actual Java code files** (e.g., `.java` files) and extract their attributes (Java fields with data types and membership, like `private String name;`) and functions (Java methods with signatures, like `public void someMethod(int param);`).

A `testng.xml` file is an XML configuration file used by the TestNG framework to define test suites, tests, and classes to run. While crucial for a Java project's testing phase, it does not contain Java class definitions, member variables, or methods in the way a `.java` file does.

Therefore, I cannot extract "attributes" (Java class fields) or "functions" (Java methods) from an XML configuration file.

**To get the desired output (a JSON summary of Java code with its attributes and functions), please provide the raw, plain text content of a Java file (`.java` file).**

Here's a response based on the information you provided, acknowledging it's an XML configuration summary:

```json
{
  "file_name": "testng.xml",
  "file_path": "Not specified",
  "file_summary": "The provided input was a JSON summary describing a `testng.xml` file. This XML file configures a TestNG test suite named \"TestAll\", containing a specific test run \"order\" that targets and executes all test classes within the `getRequest` Java package. While this file is essential for orchestrating automated tests in a Java project, it is an XML configuration and not Java source code itself. Therefore, it does not contain Java classes, attributes (fields), or functions (methods) that can be extracted according to the specified structure for Java code analysis. The summary accurately reflects its role in defining test execution flow for TestNG.",
  "attributes": [
    "Note: Attributes cannot be extracted as Java-specific elements (e.g., private fields, public methods with specific signatures) because the provided input is a JSON summary of a `testng.xml` (an XML file), not raw Java code."
  ],
  "functions": [
    "Note: Functions cannot be extracted as Java-specific elements (e.g., private fields, public methods with specific signatures) because the provided input is a JSON summary of a `testng.xml` (an XML file), not raw Java code."
