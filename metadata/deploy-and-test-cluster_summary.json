  "file_summary": "This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named 'Deploy and Test Cluster'. Its primary purpose is to automate the deployment and basic testing of a Kubernetes-based application whenever changes are pushed or a pull request is made to the 'main' branch, specifically within the 'k8s/' directory. The workflow runs on an Ubuntu environment and performs several key steps: first, it checks out the repository content. Next, it provisions a temporary Kubernetes Kind cluster. Following cluster creation, it proceeds to deploy the application by applying all Kubernetes manifests found in the 'k8s/' directory. Finally, it includes a crucial step to wait until the 'demo-db' and 'petclinic' pods are in a ready state, ensuring that the deployed application components are fully operational before the workflow concludes. This automation streamlines the CI/CD process for Kubernetes deployments.",
