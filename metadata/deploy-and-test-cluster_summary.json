  "file_summary": "This is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to automate the deployment and testing of a Kubernetes cluster. It is configured to trigger on `push` and `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch, specifically when changes are made within the `k8s/` directory. The workflow executes a single job, `deploy-and-test-cluster`, which runs on an `ubuntu-latest` environment. It performs several steps: checking out the repository, creating a local Kubernetes cluster using `kind`, deploying applications defined in the `k8s/` directory using `kubectl`, and finally, waiting for specific application pods (`demo-db` and `petclinic`) to become ready, ensuring successful deployment and basic health.",
