  "file_summary": "This file is a configuration file, typically named `maven-wrapper.properties`, used by the Apache Maven Wrapper. It defines critical parameters for how the Maven Wrapper should operate and which Maven distribution it should utilize. The file specifies the `wrapperVersion`, indicating the version of the Maven Wrapper script itself (e.g., 3.3.2). It also defines the `distributionType`, which in this case is 'only-script', implying that the wrapper manages the download and setup of Maven binaries. Most importantly, the `distributionUrl` provides the precise URL from which the Apache Maven binary distribution (version 3.9.10) should be downloaded. This mechanism ensures that any user building the project with Maven Wrapper automatically uses the exact, specified Maven version, promoting consistent and reproducible builds across different environments. The file includes a standard Apache License header, detailing the terms under which its contents are distributed and can be used.",
