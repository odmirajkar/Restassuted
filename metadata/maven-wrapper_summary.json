  "file summary": "This file is a configuration file, typically named `maven-wrapper.properties`, used by the Maven Wrapper to define how a project's Maven build environment should be set up. It specifies crucial parameters for ensuring consistent build environments across different machines and users. The `wrapperVersion` property indicates the version of the Maven Wrapper itself (3.3.2). The `distributionType` (set to 'only-script') defines that the wrapper should only execute the script, relying on the `distributionUrl` to download the specific Maven distribution if it's not already available locally. The `distributionUrl` provides the direct URL to the Apache Maven binary distribution (apache-maven-3.9.10-bin.zip) that the wrapper will download and use, thereby standardizing the Maven version for the project without requiring manual installation. This approach enhances build reproducibility and simplifies project setup for new contributors.",
