  "file_summary": "This configuration file is primarily used by the Apache Maven Wrapper. Its main purpose is to define how Maven itself should be downloaded and utilized within a project, thereby ensuring consistent build environments across various developer machines. This mechanism helps in standardizing the Maven version used for a project, mitigating 'it works on my machine' problems. The file specifies key parameters for the wrapper's operation:\n- `wrapperVersion`: Defines the version of the Maven Wrapper script itself (3.3.2 in this case).\n- `distributionType`: Indicates the type of distribution the wrapper should manage, often specifying 'only-script' to download only the necessary Maven artifacts.\n- `distributionUrl`: Provides the direct URL (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.9.10/apache-maven-3.9.10-bin.zip) from which the specific Apache Maven distribution (version 3.9.10) will be automatically downloaded and used by the wrapper when Maven commands are executed for the project. This setup automates the dependency on a particular Maven version, simplifying project setup and ensuring reliable builds for all contributors.",
