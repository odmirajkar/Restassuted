  "file_summary": "The `NamedEntity` class is a core part of the Spring PetClinic application's data model, extending the `BaseEntity`. Its primary purpose is to serve as a base class for other domain objects that require a 'name' property in addition to the 'id' provided by `BaseEntity`. Annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`, it signifies that its fields should be mapped by JPA to tables of its subclasses, but it does not represent an entity itself. The class encapsulates a single private string attribute, `name`, which is mapped to a database column named 'name' and is constrained to be non-blank using `@NotBlank` for validation. It provides standard getter and setter methods for the `name` property and overrides the `toString()` method to return the entity's name, making it convenient for logging and display purposes. This design promotes reusability and consistency across entities that require a common naming convention.",
