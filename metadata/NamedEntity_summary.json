  "file_summary": "The `NamedEntity` class extends `BaseEntity`, serving as an abstract base class for domain objects within the Spring Framework PetClinic application that require a common `name` property in addition to the `id`. This class is annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`, indicating that its properties are mapped to the database columns of its subclasses, but it does not represent a standalone database table itself. It introduces a `private String name` attribute, which is mapped to a database column named 'name' and is constrained by `@NotBlank` to ensure it's not null or empty. The class provides standard getter and setter methods for the `name` property and overrides the `toString()` method to return the entity's name, which is useful for debugging and display purposes. This design promotes reusability and consistency for entities that are identified by both an ID and a name.",
