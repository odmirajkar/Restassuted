  "file_summary": "The `NamedEntity` class is a core component within the Spring PetClinic application's domain model, extending the `BaseEntity` to incorporate a common `name` property. Its primary purpose is to serve as a base class for other domain objects that require both an ID (inherited from `BaseEntity`) and a name. By being annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`, `NamedEntity` itself is not directly mapped to a database table; instead, its persistence attributes (including the `id` from `BaseEntity` and its own `name` field) are inherited by its subclasses that are actual JPA entities. The `name` field is a `String` type, mapped to a database column named \"name\" via `@Column`, and is enforced to be non-blank using the `@NotBlank` validation annotation. The class provides standard getter (`getName()`) and setter (`setName(String name)`) methods for the `name` property. Additionally, it overrides the `toString()` method to return the entity's `name`, which is useful for debugging and displaying meaningful object representations.",
