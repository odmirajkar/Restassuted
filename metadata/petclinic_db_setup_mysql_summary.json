  "file_summary": "This document provides step-by-step instructions for configuring and running the Spring PetClinic sample application with a MySQL database. It outlines three main stages: first, obtaining a MySQL database instance, either by downloading and installing MySQL Community Server or by leveraging the provided `docker-compose.yml` for a quick setup using Docker. Second, it details the one-time process of creating the 'petclinic' database and a dedicated user, noting that this is automatically handled when using the Docker Compose setup. Lastly, the instructions explain how to activate the `mysql` Spring profile, typically by setting `spring.profiles.active=mysql` as a system property when launching the application, for example, via Maven. The document emphasizes the prerequisite that the 'petclinic' database must exist for the application to connect successfully using its default JDBC configuration, a condition ensured by either the Docker setup or manual execution of the `user.sql` script."
