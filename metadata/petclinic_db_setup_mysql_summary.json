  "file_summary": "This document provides setup instructions for configuring the Spring PetClinic sample application to use a MySQL database. It outlines three main steps: first, downloading and installing MySQL (or using the provided Docker Compose setup for a containerized MySQL instance); second, creating the 'petclinic' database and a dedicated user (though this is often handled automatically by Docker Compose or a `user.sql` script); and third, running the Spring Boot application with the `mysql` Spring profile activated, typically via a command-line argument like `-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql`. The document emphasizes that the 'petclinic' database must exist for the application to function correctly with the default JDBC URL configuration.",
