  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, commonly used in Java applications for externalizing and localizing user interface text, messages, and labels. Specifically, this file contains the Russian (ru) translations for the PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to enable internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to display its content in Russian when the user's locale is set accordingly. The file comprises a collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a corresponding Russian string. The content covers a wide array of application messages, including general welcome and error messages like \"Добро пожаловать\" (Welcome) and \"Ошибка\" (Error), as well as validation messages such as \"необходимо\" (required), \"неправильная даные\" (invalid date), and \"Телефон должен содержать 10 цифр\" (Telephone must be a 10-digit number). It also defines labels for various entities and their attributes within the application, such as \"Владелец\" (Owner), \"Питомец\" (Pet), \"Имя\" (Name), \"Адрес\" (Address), and \"Дата рождения\" (Birth Date). Furthermore, it provides Russian labels for navigation elements and actions, including \"Добавить владельца\" (Add Owner), \"Найти владельца\" (Find Owner), \"Редактировать питомца\" (Edit Pet), \"Главная\" (Home), and pagination terms like \"Первый\" (First) and \"Следующий\" (Next). This file is essential for providing a fully localized user experience for Russian-speaking users of the application.",
