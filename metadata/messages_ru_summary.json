  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, specifically configured for internationalization (i18n) to provide Russian (ru) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It functions as a resource bundle, mapping various keys to their corresponding Russian translations. These translations are utilized across the application's user interface for labels, form field names, button texts, navigation links, and validation messages. The content clearly indicates its purpose within a 'PetClinic :: демонстрация Spring Framework' (PetClinic :: Spring Framework demonstration) context, as seen in the 'layoutTitle' entry. It covers a wide array of application-specific terms, including entities like 'Владелец' (Owner), 'Питомцы' (Pets), and 'Ветеринары' (Veterinarians), along with common form attributes such as 'Имя' (First Name), 'Фамилия' (Last Name), 'Адрес' (Address), and 'Телефон' (Telephone). Furthermore, it includes crucial action-oriented labels like 'Добавить владельца' (Add Owner), 'Редактировать питомца' (Edit Pet), and 'Добавить визит' (Add Visit), as well as common error and validation messages such as 'необходимо' (required) and 'неправильная дата' (invalid date). This file is essential for delivering a fully localized user experience in Russian for the application.",
