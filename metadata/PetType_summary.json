  "file_summary": "The `PetType.java` file defines the `PetType` class, a core entity in the Spring PetClinic application responsible for categorizing different types of pets such as \"Cat\", \"Dog\", or \"Hamster\". This class extends `NamedEntity`, inheriting properties like an ID and a name. It is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"types\")`, marking it as a JPA entity that maps to the `types` table in the database. Its primary role is to provide a lookup for various pet species, ensuring data integrity and consistency within the application's pet management system. It doesn't contain any custom business logic but serves as a fundamental data structure for pet classification.",
