  "file_summary": "The `PetType` class is a core domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, located in the `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner` package. Its primary purpose is to represent and categorize different types of pets, such as 'Cat', 'Dog', or 'Hamster'. This class is designed as a simple data holder, inheriting its fundamental properties, specifically an `id` and a `name`, from the `NamedEntity` abstract class. This inheritance pattern makes `PetType` self-sufficient for identification solely based on its name.\n\nAnnotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"types\")`, `PetType` is configured as a JPA (Java Persistence API) entity. This ensures that instances of `PetType` can be seamlessly persisted to and retrieved from a database table named 'types'. It acts as a lookup or reference entity, providing a standardized way to define and manage the available pet categories within the system, which are then referenced by `Pet` objects. The class itself does not introduce any new attributes or methods beyond what is inherited, emphasizing a clean and focused design for defining pet classifications.",
