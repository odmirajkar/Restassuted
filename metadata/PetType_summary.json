  "file_summary": "The `PetType` class is a simple JavaBean domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, representing a type of pet (e.g., Cat, Dog, Hamster). It extends the `NamedEntity` class, inheriting properties such as an `id` and a `name`. This class is annotated as a JPA `@Entity` and is mapped to the `types` table in the database. Its primary purpose is to categorize pets, providing a common lookup for the type of animal. As a `NamedEntity` subclass, it primarily relies on the inherited `name` property to define the pet type. This class acts as a reference data entity, allowing for predefined and managed pet types in the application, rather than free-text input.",
