  "file summary": "This CSS snippet defines responsive styles specifically for screen widths up to 768 pixels, typically targeting tablets and mobile devices. It leverages a `@media` query to apply a set of rules that adjust the layout and appearance of various elements for smaller viewports. Key adjustments include repositioning the `.navbar-toggle` button to the absolute top-left, centering the `.navbar a.navbar-brand` (logo) with a mobile-specific background image and hiding its text, and modifying the font size and line height of `.homepage-billboard .homepage-subtitle`. Additionally, it removes the top border of the `.navbar` and adjusts the margins for `.xd-container` and `.index-page--subtitle` to ensure optimal spacing and readability on smaller screens, thereby enhancing the mobile user experience.",
