  "file_summary": "This CSS file defines responsive styling rules specifically for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels, typically targeting mobile devices and smaller tablets. Its primary purpose is to optimize the layout and appearance of several key components for a better mobile user experience. It adjusts the positioning and z-index of the `.navbar-toggle` for accessibility, modifies the `.navbar-brand` (logo) to be centered, smaller, and use a mobile-specific background image, while hiding its hover effect (`span`). It also reduces the top border of the `.navbar` and adjusts the margins of `.xd-container` and `.index-page--subtitle` elements to save space and improve readability on smaller screens. The `.homepage-billboard .homepage-subtitle` font size and line height are also adjusted for better display.",
