  "file_summary": "This CSS file is dedicated to providing responsive design adjustments for web pages, specifically targeting screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels (e.g., mobile devices and tablets). It contains `@media` queries that override or modify default styles to optimize the user experience on smaller screens. Key adjustments include repositioning the `.navbar-toggle` button to the top-left, transforming the `.navbar-brand` logo into a mobile-specific version (using a different image and centering it), and hiding its hover effect. It also removes the top border of the main navigation bar. Furthermore, the file fine-tunes the spacing and typography for elements like `.xd-container`, `.index-page--subtitle`, and `.homepage-billboard .homepage-subtitle`, ensuring proper layout and readability when viewed on compact displays.",
