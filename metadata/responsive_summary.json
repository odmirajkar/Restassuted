Within this media query, it adjusts the layout and appearance of various components for mobile responsiveness. Key changes include absolutely positioning the `.navbar-toggle` button, centering the `.navbar-brand` logo and changing its background image to a mobile-specific version while hiding its text, modifying the font size and line height of the `.homepage-subtitle`, removing the top border of the `.navbar`, and adjusting the margins for `.xd-container` and `.index-page--subtitle` elements. The overall purpose is to optimize the user interface for smaller screen sizes, providing a better mobile viewing experience.",
