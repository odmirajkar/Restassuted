  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, specifically configured for internationalization (i18n) to provide Persian (fa) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It functions as a resource bundle, mapping various keys to their corresponding Persian translations. These translations are used across the application's user interface for labels, form fields, button texts, navigation links, and validation messages. The content explicitly references its purpose within a 'PetClinic :: a Spring Framework demonstration' context, as indicated by the 'layoutTitle' entry. It covers a wide range of application terms, including entities like 'مالک' (Owner), 'حیوانات خانگی' (Pets), and 'دامپزشکان' (Veterinarians), along with their associated attributes such as 'نام' (First Name), 'نام خانوادگی' (Last Name), 'آدرس' (Address), and 'تاریخ تولد' (Birth Date). Furthermore, it includes crucial action-oriented labels like 'افزودن مالک' (Add Owner), 'ویرایش حیوان خانگی' (Edit Pet), and 'افزودن ویزیت' (Add Visit), as well as common error and validation messages such as 'الزامی' (required) and 'تاریخ نامعتبر' (invalid date). This file is essential for delivering a fully localized user experience in Persian for the application.",
