  "file_summary": "This file is a properties file commonly used for internationalization (i18n) in applications. It contains key-value pairs, where keys are typically English identifiers or message codes, and values are their corresponding translations in Persian (Farsi). The content strongly suggests it belongs to a 'PetClinic' type application, providing localized text for various UI elements, form fields, validation messages, and general application labels. It covers terms related to owners (e.g., 'firstName', 'lastName', 'addOwner'), pets (e.g., 'birthDate', 'type', 'addVisit'), veterinarians ('vets', 'specialties'), and common application messages like 'welcome', 'error', 'notFound', and navigation controls ('next', 'previous'). Its primary purpose is to enable the application to display its user interface and messages in Persian, supporting a localized user experience.",
