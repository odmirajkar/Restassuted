  "file_summary": "This Java class, `PetControllerTests`, is a comprehensive unit test suite for the `PetController` in the Spring PetClinic application. It utilizes Spring's `@WebMvcTest` to focus on the web layer, isolating the controller logic from the full application context. The tests simulate HTTP requests using `MockMvc` to verify the `PetController`'s behavior for creating and updating pet records. Key dependencies like `OwnerRepository` and `PetTypeRepository` are mocked using `MockitoBean` to control their responses. The test cases cover various scenarios, including successful form submissions, as well as handling validation errors such as blank names, duplicate pet names, missing pet types, and invalid birth dates. It ensures that the controller correctly renders views, manages model attributes, and redirects upon successful operations, adhering to the application's business rules and user interface expectations.",
