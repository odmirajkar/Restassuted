  "file_summary": "This Java class, `VisitControllerTests`, is responsible for testing the web layer functionalities of the `VisitController` within the Spring PetClinic application. It utilizes Spring Boot's `@WebMvcTest` annotation to focus on MVC components, specifically `VisitController`, without loading the full application context. The tests leverage `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and verify the controller's behavior, including status codes, view names, and model attributes. It also uses `@MockitoBean` to mock the `OwnerRepository` dependency, ensuring that the tests are isolated to the controller's logic. The class covers scenarios like initializing a new visit form, successfully submitting a new visit, and handling validation errors during visit submission. It's configured to be disabled in native image and AOT modes.",
