  "file_summary": "This Java class, `VisitControllerTests`, provides integration tests for the `VisitController` in the Spring PetClinic application. It is configured with `@WebMvcTest` to focus on testing the web layer, allowing the simulation of HTTP requests to the controller without needing to start a full Spring application context. The tests utilize `MockMvc` to perform GET and POST requests to various endpoints related to pet visits. The `OwnerRepository` is mocked using `@MockitoBean` to control its behavior and isolate the controller logic from the database, ensuring predictable test outcomes. The `init()` method sets up a mock owner and pet for tests to use. This test suite covers the functionality of initializing the new visit form, successfully processing a new visit form submission (redirecting upon success), and handling form submissions that contain errors (staying on the form and displaying errors).",
