  "file_summary": "This `package-info.java` file serves as a package-level documentation and annotation placeholder for the `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.model` package. It contains a Javadoc comment describing the purpose of the classes within this package, stating that they represent utilities used by the domain. This file does not define any classes, interfaces, enums, or annotations directly, nor does it contain any executable code. Its primary role is to provide package-level metadata, which can include Javadoc comments, package-level annotations, and a common place for package-private definitions, although none are present here other than the documentation.",
