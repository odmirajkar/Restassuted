  "file_summary": "This `package-info.java` file serves as a package-level documentation file for the `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.model` package within the Spring PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to provide a high-level description of the classes and interfaces contained within this package. As indicated by its Javadoc comment, this package specifically holds classes that represent the core domain objects of the application, which are essentially the business entities and their relationships. These domain objects are typically simple JavaBean objects that often correspond to database tables or views, forming the 'model' layer in the application's architecture. This file doesn't contain executable code, attributes, or functions; rather, it provides metadata and descriptive information about the package's contents and their collective purpose.",
