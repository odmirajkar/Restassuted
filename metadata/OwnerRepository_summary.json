  "file_summary": "This file defines the `OwnerRepository` interface, which is a Spring Data JPA repository responsible for managing `Owner` domain objects. It extends `JpaRepository<Owner, Integer>`, providing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for `Owner` entities, using `Integer` as the primary key type. The interface includes custom query methods beyond the basic CRUD operations. Specifically, it allows retrieving owners whose last name starts with a given string, supporting pagination, and provides a method to find an owner by their ID, returning an `Optional<Owner>` for robust null handling. This repository abstracts the data access layer for owners within the Pet Clinic application, adhering to Spring Data naming conventions for easy extension and integration.",
