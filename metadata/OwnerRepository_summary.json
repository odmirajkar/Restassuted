  "file_summary": "The `OwnerRepository` interface serves as a data access layer for `Owner` domain objects within the Spring PetClinic application. It extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository`, automatically providing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for `Owner` entities, identified by their `Integer` ID.\n\nIn addition to the inherited methods, this interface defines custom query methods that adhere to Spring Data naming conventions for easy query creation:\n- `findByLastNameStartingWith`: Allows searching for owners whose last names begin with a specified string, supporting pagination through the `Pageable` parameter.\n- `findById`: Overrides the default `findById` to explicitly return an `Optional<Owner>`, promoting safer handling of potentially non-existent entities. This repository acts as the bridge between the application's service layer and the underlying database, abstracting away the complexities of data persistence for `Owner` objects.",
