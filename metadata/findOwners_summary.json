  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template designed for the Spring PetClinic application, serving as the user interface for searching existing owners. It integrates with a common layout fragment (`fragments/layout`) to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application, specifically within the 'owners' section. The main feature is a search form (`id=\"search-owner-form\"`) that allows users to find owners by their last name. The form binds to an `owner` object, and the input field for 'lastName' uses Thymeleaf's `th:field` for data binding. It includes validation error display (`#fields.hasAnyErrors()`) to provide feedback to the user. The form submits a GET request to the `/owners` endpoint, which is typical for search operations. Additionally, the page provides a prominent 'Find Owner' button to submit the search and an 'Add Owner' button (`th:href=\"@{/owners/new}\"`) that navigates the user to a page for creating a new owner. All text labels are internationalized using Thymeleaf's message expressions (e.g., `#{findOwners}`, `#{lastName}`).",
