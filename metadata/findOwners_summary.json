  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template designed for the 'Find Owners' functionality within a web application. Its primary purpose is to provide a user interface for searching pet owners based on their last name. The page displays a form where users can input the last name, utilizing Thymeleaf's form binding (`th:object=\"${owner}\"`, `th:field=\"*{lastName}\"`) to interact with a backend owner object. It includes internationalization support for text labels like 'Find Owners', 'Last name', 'Find Owner', and 'Add Owner'. The form submits a GET request to the `/owners` endpoint. Additionally, the template incorporates basic error display for the 'lastName' field and provides a link to navigate to the 'Add Owner' page (`/owners/new`). The page inherits its layout from a common `fragments/layout.html` file, ensuring a consistent user experience.",
