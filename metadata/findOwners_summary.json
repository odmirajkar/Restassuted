  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template used for the 'Find Owners' functionality within a web application, likely a Spring PetClinic-like application. It provides a user interface with a search form where users can input an owner's last name to find existing owner records. The form includes error handling display using Thymeleaf's field error mechanisms. Additionally, the page offers a button to submit the search query and a link to navigate to a separate page for adding new owner records. The overall layout and styling of this page are managed by a common `fragments/layout` template, ensuring consistent presentation across the application.",
