  "file summary": "This HTML document is a Thymeleaf template designed for the 'owners' section of an application, serving as a user interface to search for existing owners and to navigate to a page for adding new ones. It integrates with a common layout (`fragments/layout`) to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.\n\nThe core functionality is provided by a `form` with the ID `search-owner-form`, which is bound to an `owner` object and submits a `GET` request to the `/owners` endpoint. This form primarily allows users to search for owners by their `lastName` via an input field. The template includes robust error handling using Thymeleaf's `#fields` utility, which displays validation messages if any errors are associated with the form fields, specifically for the `lastName` input.\n\nIn addition to the search capability, the page features two main actions: a 'Find Owner' submit button that triggers the search, and an 'Add Owner' button that acts as a hyperlink, redirecting the user to the `/owners/new` URL to create a new owner record. All user-facing text elements within the template are internationalized using Thymeleaf's `#{...}` syntax, allowing for easy localization. The use of CSS classes like `form-horizontal`, `form-group`, `control-label`, and `btn btn-primary` suggests a reliance on a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling and layout.",
