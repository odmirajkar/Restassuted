  "file_summary": "This file is a configuration file, very likely a `gradle-wrapper.properties` file, which is integral to projects that use the Gradle build automation tool. Its primary purpose is to define the properties for the Gradle Wrapper, ensuring that all users working on the project use a consistent and specified version of Gradle. Key parameters include `distributionUrl`, which points to the exact Gradle distribution ZIP file to be downloaded, and `distributionSha256Sum` for verifying the integrity of the downloaded file. It also specifies the base directories (`distributionBase`, `zipStoreBase`) and paths (`distributionPath`, `zipStorePath`) within `GRADLE_USER_HOME` where the Gradle distribution and its archives are stored. Furthermore, it configures network timeout settings and specifies whether to validate the distribution URL. This configuration guarantees reproducible builds across different development environments by standardizing the Gradle version and setup.",
