  "file_summary": "This SQL script provides initial seed data for a relational database, likely intended for a pet clinic management system. It consists of multiple `INSERT IGNORE INTO` statements that populate seven distinct tables: `vets`, `specialties`, `vet_specialties`, `types`, `owners`, `pets`, and `visits`. The `vets` table stores details about the veterinarians, including their names. `specialties` lists various medical specializations. The `vet_specialties` table establishes a many-to-many relationship, associating vets with their specific areas of expertise. Pet categories like 'cat', 'dog', etc., are defined in the `types` table. Customer information, such as names, addresses, and contact details, is stored in the `owners` table. The `pets` table records data about individual animals, linking them to their owners and types. Finally, the `visits` table logs details of each animal's visit to the clinic, including the reason and date. The use of `INSERT IGNORE INTO` ensures that data is only added if it doesn't already exist, making the script idempotent and suitable for initial setup or re-population without creating duplicate entries.",
