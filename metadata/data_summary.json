  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a relational database with initial, static data for a pet clinic application. It systematically inserts records into various tables, including 'vets' (veterinarians), 'specialties' (medical specializations), 'vet_specialties' (linking vets to their specialties), 'types' (different pet categories), 'owners' (pet owners' details), 'pets' (individual pet information), and 'visits' (records of pet visits). A key feature of this script is its idempotency, achieved through the use of 'WHERE NOT EXISTS' clauses for most INSERT statements and 'ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING' for 'vet_specialties'. This robust approach ensures that the script can be executed multiple times without creating duplicate entries, making it ideal for database initialization, development environments, and migration scenarios. The comprehensive dataset provided by this script is essential for setting up a functional base for the application, allowing for immediate testing and demonstration of its features without requiring manual data input."
