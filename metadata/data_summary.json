  "file summary": "This file contains a series of SQL INSERT statements primarily used to populate a relational database with initial sample data for a veterinary clinic application. It systematically adds records into various tables, including `vets` (information about veterinarians), `specialties` (different medical specializations), `vet_specialties` (a mapping table linking vets to their specialties), `types` (classifications of pets like 'cat' or 'dog'), `owners` (details of pet owners), `pets` (information about individual animals, linking them to owners and types), and `visits` (records of medical appointments for pets). This script is crucial for setting up a development or testing environment, providing a realistic dataset to test the application's functionality, demonstrate data relationships, and ensure the database schema is correctly populated for immediate use.",
