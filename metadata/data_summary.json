  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a relational database with initial sample data, likely for a pet clinic or veterinary management application. It contains a comprehensive set of `INSERT` statements that populate several interconnected tables. Specifically, it adds records for veterinarians (`vets`) and their associated medical specialties (`specialties` and `vet_specialties`). Furthermore, it defines various pet types (`types`), registers pet owners (`owners`), and then creates detailed records for individual pets (`pets`), linking them to their respective types and owners. Finally, the script includes data for `visits`, logging specific medical appointments or treatments for the pets. This file serves as a seed data script, crucial for setting up a functional environment for development, testing, or initial deployment, ensuring the application has a foundational dataset to operate with.",
