  "file_summary": "This file is an SQL script primarily used for populating a relational database schema, likely for a 'pet clinic' or similar application. It contains a series of `INSERT IGNORE INTO` statements, designed to add initial data into several tables. The tables being populated include `vets` (veterinarian details), `specialties` (medical specializations for vets), `vet_specialties` (a join table linking vets to their specialties), `types` (categories of pets like 'cat', 'dog'), `owners` (details of pet owners), `pets` (information about the pets themselves, including their type and owner), and `visits` (records of pet visits to the clinic, including dates and descriptions). The `IGNORE` clause ensures that if a row with the same primary key already exists, the insertion is skipped without error, making the script idempotent and safe to run multiple times.",
