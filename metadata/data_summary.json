  "file_summary": "This SQL script serves as a data initialization file, designed to populate a relational database with sample records for a typical pet clinic application. It consists entirely of `INSERT INTO` statements that systematically add data across various tables within the database schema. Specifically, the script populates the `vets` table with veterinarian profiles, `specialties` with medical specializations, and `vet_specialties` to link vets to their respective areas of expertise. Furthermore, it defines different `types` of pets, registers `owners` with their contact details, and records `pets` with their names, birth dates, types, and associated owners. Finally, the `visits` table is populated with historical visit data for various pets, including the visit date and a description of the visit. This script is crucial for setting up a functional database environment, enabling immediate testing, development, or demonstration of the application without manual data entry. It provides a comprehensive set of interconnected sample data reflecting the core entities and relationships in a pet clinic domain.",
