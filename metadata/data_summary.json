  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a relational database with initial sample data for a pet clinic application. It systematically inserts records into various interconnected tables: `vets`, `specialties`, `vet_specialties`, `types`, `owners`, `pets`, and `visits`. Each `INSERT` statement is crafted for idempotency, primarily utilizing `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...)` clauses for most tables and `ON CONFLICT (column_list) DO NOTHING` for the `vet_specialties` join table. This approach ensures that the script can be run multiple times without creating duplicate entries, making it suitable for database initialization or development environment setup.\n\nThe script first adds six veterinarian profiles. Following this, it defines three core medical specialties. It then establishes the relationships between specific veterinarians and their specialties. Animal types, such as 'cat' or 'dog', are also inserted. A comprehensive list of ten pet owners, including their contact details, is then added. Subsequently, thirteen individual pet records are inserted, linking each pet to its owner and type. Finally, it populates the `visits` table with four records detailing veterinary appointments for specific pets, including the date and a description of the visit. This script provides a ready-to-use dataset for testing or demonstrating a pet clinic management system.",
