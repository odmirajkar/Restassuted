  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a relational database with initial sample data for a 'Pet Clinic' style application. It systematically inserts records into several tables, including 'vets' (veterinarians), 'specialties' (veterinarian specializations), 'vet_specialties' (a linking table for vets and their specialties), 'types' (pet types like cat, dog), 'owners' (pet owners), 'pets', and 'visits' (pet visit history). Each `INSERT` statement uses a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` clause (or `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for `vet_specialties`) to ensure idempotency, preventing duplicate data insertion if the script is run multiple times. This makes it suitable for setting up a development or demonstration environment with predefined, consistent data.",
