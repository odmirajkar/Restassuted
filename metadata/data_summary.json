It inserts sample data into several tables, including 'vets' (veterinarian details), 'specialties' (medical specializations), 'vet_specialties' (linking vets to their specialties), 'types' (different animal types like cat, dog, etc.), 'owners' (pet owner information), 'pets' (details about pets, including their type and owner), and 'visits' (records of pet visits to the clinic, including date and description). This script is essential for setting up an initial dataset for testing or demonstrating the application's functionality.",
