  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a database with initial sample data for a pet clinic application. It contains a series of `INSERT IGNORE INTO` statements, ensuring that the data is added only if it does not already exist, preventing duplicate entries upon re-execution. The script inserts records into several tables, including:\n- `vets`: Details of veterinarians (ID, first name, last name).\n- `specialties`: Types of medical specialties (ID, name).\n- `vet_specialties`: A linking table establishing many-to-many relationships between vets and their specialties.\n- `types`: Categories of pets (ID, name).\n- `owners`: Information about pet owners (ID, first name, last name, address, city, telephone).\n- `pets`: Details of pets, linking them to their types and owners (ID, name, birth date, type ID, owner ID).\n- `visits`: Records of visits made by pets, including visit date and description (ID, pet ID, visit date, description).\n\nOverall, this script provides a foundational dataset for testing or demonstrating the functionality of a pet clinic management system.",
