  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a database with initial data for a pet clinic application. It contains a series of INSERT INTO statements that add records to several tables. Specifically, it populates the 'vets' table with veterinarian details, 'specialties' with various medical specialties, and 'vet_specialties' to link vets with their specializations. It also adds different 'types' of pets, 'owners' with their contact information, 'pets' belonging to these owners, and 'visits' details including dates and descriptions of services rendered. This script is crucial for setting up a functional dataset, enabling testing and initial operation of the application by providing foundational reference data across multiple interconnected entities.",
