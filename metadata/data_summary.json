  "file summary": "This SQL script is designed to populate a relational database with initial sample data for a pet clinic application. It systematically inserts records into various tables, including `vets` (veterinary professionals), `specialties` (medical specializations), `vet_specialties` (linking vets to their specialties), `types` (different animal types like cat, dog, etc.), `owners` (pet owners' details), `pets` (individual pet profiles), and `visits` (records of veterinary appointments). A key feature of this script is its idempotence: each `INSERT` statement is conditionally executed using a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` clause or `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. This ensures that data is inserted only if it doesn't already exist in the respective tables, preventing duplicate entries and allowing the script to be run multiple times without issues. The script establishes a foundational dataset crucial for testing, demonstrating, or initializing a pet clinic database.",
