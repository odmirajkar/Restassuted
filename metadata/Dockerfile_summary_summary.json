If the file contents you intend to provide are a Dockerfile (or any other non-Java file), then the `attributes` (with Java-specific data types and membership types like `private static int`) and `functions` (with Java-specific return types and parameters) sections of the JSON structure would not be applicable.

Please provide the actual content of the file. If it's a Dockerfile or another non-Java file, I will:
1.  Fill `file_name`, `file_path`, and `file_summary` appropriately for that file type.
2.  For `attributes` and `functions`, I will either leave them as empty arrays or add a clear note within the arrays indicating that these fields are not applicable to the provided file type as they are designed for Java code.
