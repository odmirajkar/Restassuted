  "file_summary": "This Java file, `ValidatorTests.java`, is a unit test class designed to verify the proper functioning of Bean Validation for the `Person` model within the Spring PetClinic sample application. Its main goal is to ensure that validation constraints are correctly applied and enforced, especially useful when upgrading underlying validation libraries like Hibernate Validator. The class uses JUnit 5 for testing and leverages Spring's `LocalValidatorFactoryBean` to obtain a `jakarta.validation.Validator` instance. It contains a specific test case, `shouldNotValidateWhenFirstNameEmpty`, which asserts that a `Person` object with an empty first name correctly triggers a `ConstraintViolation` on the `firstName` property, confirming the 'must not be blank' validation rule is active and working as expected.",
