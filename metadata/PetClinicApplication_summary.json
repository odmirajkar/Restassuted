  "file_summary": "The `PetClinicApplication` class serves as the primary entry point for the Spring PetClinic application, leveraging Spring Boot's conventions to simplify development and deployment. Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, it enables auto-configuration, component scanning, and embeddable web server capabilities. The `main` method within this class uses `SpringApplication.run` to bootstrap the entire Spring application context, making it runnable as a standalone JAR. Additionally, the `@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)` annotation signifies its use for Spring Native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, providing necessary runtime hints for reflection and other dynamic features to ensure the application works correctly when compiled into a native executable. This class is fundamental for starting the PetClinic web application.",
