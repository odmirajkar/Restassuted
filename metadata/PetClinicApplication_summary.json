  "file_summary": "This file serves as the main entry point for the PetClinic Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` to provide a complete Spring Boot setup. This enables automatic configuration based on classpath dependencies, component scanning for beans, and marks the class as a source of bean definitions. Additionally, it uses `@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)`, suggesting an optimization for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation or native image generation by registering runtime hints. The `main` method within this class is the standard Java entry point, responsible for bootstrapping and running the Spring application using `SpringApplication.run()`, making it the starting point for the entire PetClinic service.",
