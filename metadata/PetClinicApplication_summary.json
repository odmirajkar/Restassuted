  "file_summary": "The `PetClinicApplication` class serves as the main entry point for the Spring PetClinic application. Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, it signifies a standard Spring Boot application, enabling auto-configuration, component scanning, and externalized configuration. Its primary purpose is to bootstrap and launch the PetClinic application using Spring Boot's conventional `SpringApplication.run()` method. This class is responsible for initializing the Spring application context, making it ready to serve web requests and manage the application's components. The presence of `@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)` indicates its preparedness for GraalVM native image compilation, ensuring that necessary runtime reflections and resources are included for optimal performance in a native executable environment. This setup exemplifies a typical Spring Boot web application structure.",
