  "file_summary": "This Java class serves as the main entry point for the PetClinic Spring Boot application. Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, it enables various Spring Boot features like auto-configuration, component scanning, and externalized configuration. Its primary purpose is to bootstrap and launch the entire application using the `SpringApplication.run()` method within its `main` function. Additionally, it includes `@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)`, indicating its preparation for GraalVM native image compilation by providing necessary runtime hints. This setup allows the PetClinic application to be packaged and run efficiently as a standalone executable.",
