  "file_summary": "This file serves as a crucial localization resource, specifically providing Turkish translations for a Spring PetClinic application. It contains a comprehensive collection of key-value pairs, where each key acts as an identifier for various user interface elements, labels, and messages within the application, and its corresponding value is the translated Turkish text. The primary purpose of this file is to enable the application to display its content in Turkish, catering to Turkish-speaking users. It covers a wide range of common UI elements, including labels for owner details like first name, last name, address, and telephone, as well as pet information such as birth date and type. Furthermore, it provides translations for navigation links (e.g., 'home', 'find owner', 'add owner'), titles for different sections (e.g., 'owners', 'vets'), and various error messages (e.g., 'required', 'notFound', 'typeMismatch.date', 'duplicate'). By centralizing these translations, the file facilitates internationalization (i18n) efforts, ensuring a localized and user-friendly experience for Turkish users without requiring modifications to the core application code. This approach makes the application adaptable to different linguistic contexts efficiently.",
