  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, commonly used in Java applications for externalizing and localizing user interface text, messages, and labels. Specifically, this file contains the Turkish (tr) translations for the PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to enable internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to display its content in Turkish when the user's locale is set accordingly. The file comprises a collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a corresponding Turkish string. The content covers a wide array of application messages, including general welcome and error messages like \"hoş geldiniz\" (Welcome) and \"Hata\" (Error), as well as validation messages such as \"gerekli\" (required), \"geçersiz tarih\" (invalid date), and \"Telefon numarası 10 basamaklı olmalıdır\" (Telephone must be a 10-digit number). It also defines labels for various entities and their attributes within the application, such as \"Sahip\" (Owner), \"Evcil Hayvan\" (Pet), \"Ad\" (Name), \"Adres\" (Address), and \"Doğum Tarihi\" (Birth Date). Furthermore, it provides Turkish labels for navigation elements and actions, including \"Sahip Ekle\" (Add Owner), \"Sahip Bul\" (Find Owner), \"Evcil Hayvanı Düzenle\" (Edit Pet), \"Ana Sayfa\" (Home), and pagination terms like \"İlk\" (First) and \"Sonraki\" (Next). This file is essential for providing a fully localized user experience for Turkish-speaking users of the application.",
