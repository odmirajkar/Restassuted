  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, specifically configured for internationalization (i18n) to provide Turkish (tr) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It functions as a resource bundle, mapping various keys to their corresponding Turkish translations. These translations are used across the application's user interface for labels, form field names, button texts, navigation links, and validation messages. The content explicitly states its purpose within a 'PetClinic :: bir Spring Framework demosu' (PetClinic :: a Spring Framework demo) context, as seen in the 'layoutTitle' entry. It covers a wide range of application-specific terms, including entities like 'Sahip' (Owner), 'Evcil Hayvanlar' (Pets), and 'Veterinerler' (Veterinarians), along with common form attributes such as 'Ad' (First Name), 'Soyad' (Last Name), 'Adres' (Address), and 'Telefon' (Telephone). Furthermore, it includes crucial action-oriented labels like 'Sahip Ekle' (Add Owner), 'Evcil Hayvanı Düzenle' (Edit Pet), and 'Ziyaret Ekle' (Add Visit), as well as common error and validation messages such as 'gerekli' (required) and 'geçersiz tarih' (invalid date). This file is essential for delivering a fully localized user experience in Turkish for the application.",
