  "file_summary": "This HTML file defines a core Thymeleaf layout fragment named 'layout', serving as the primary template for the web application's pages. Its purpose is to establish a consistent user interface, including a shared header, a dynamic navigation bar, and a footer section. The layout accepts 'template' and 'menu' parameters, allowing it to insert specific page content (`template`) and highlight the currently active navigation item (`menu`). It integrates external resources like Bootstrap for responsive design, Font Awesome for icons, and a custom `petclinic.css` for styling. The navigation bar features pre-defined links for key application sections (Home, Find Owners, Veterinarians, Error), utilizing a nested `menuItem` fragment for dynamic generation and active state highlighting. This modular approach ensures design consistency, minimizes code duplication, and simplifies UI maintenance across the application.",
