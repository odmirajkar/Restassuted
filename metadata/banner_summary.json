It features a distinctive cat-like figure along with the stylized 'Spring' framework logo in ASCII text. Below the main art, it indicates that the application was 'Built with Spring Boot' and includes a placeholder for the specific Spring Boot version (`${spring-boot.version}`), which gets dynamically replaced during application startup. Its primary purpose is to provide visual branding and basic build information at the application's launch.",
