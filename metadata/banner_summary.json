  "file_summary": "This file contains decorative ASCII art and build information, most likely serving as a custom banner for a software application. The content begins with a large, intricate ASCII art depiction of a cat, which often serves as a mascot or a playful visual element in project outputs. Following the cat artwork, there is a series of interconnected ASCII characters forming a complex pattern, potentially acting as a stylized separator or part of a larger project logo. The final line of the file, \":: Built with Spring Boot :: ${spring-boot.version}\", explicitly indicates that the associated project is built using the Spring Boot framework. The inclusion of `${spring-boot.version}` signifies that this file is designed to be processed by a build system or the Spring Boot application itself, where the placeholder would be dynamically replaced with the actual version number of Spring Boot used in the build. Such files are commonly named `banner.txt` and placed in the `src/main/resources` directory of a Spring Boot project, automatically displayed in the console when the application starts, providing immediate visual branding and crucial build information to users or developers. Its primary purpose is to enhance the user experience by providing a custom, informative startup screen.",
