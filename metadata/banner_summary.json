  "file_summary": "This file contains an ASCII art banner, which is typically displayed in the console when a Spring Boot application initializes. The banner features a stylized cat-like figure (often referred to as 'Spring Boot's cat') alongside the prominent text 'Built with Spring Boot :: ${spring-boot.version}'. The `${spring-boot.version}` is a placeholder that gets dynamically replaced with the actual version of Spring Boot used by the application at runtime. The primary purpose of such a banner is to provide a distinctive visual identifier upon application startup, confirming that the application is built with and running on the Spring Boot framework. It serves as a decorative and informational element rather than containing executable code or functional configuration, contributing to the user experience and branding of Spring Boot applications during their launch process.",
