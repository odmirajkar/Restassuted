  "file_summary": "This Kubernetes manifest defines the necessary components to deploy a PostgreSQL database instance within a Kubernetes cluster. It comprises three main resources:\n\n1.  **Secret (demo-db):** This resource securely stores sensitive configuration details for the PostgreSQL database, including the database type, provider, host, port, database name, username, and password. It's configured with the `servicebinding.io/postgresql` type, indicating its purpose for service binding.\n\n2.  **Service (demo-db):** This resource creates a stable network endpoint for the PostgreSQL database deployment. It exposes the database on port 5432 internally within the Kubernetes cluster, allowing other applications within the cluster to connect to it using the service name `demo-db`.\n\n3.  **Deployment (demo-db):** This resource manages the deployment and scaling of the PostgreSQL container. It specifies the `postgres:17.5` Docker image and injects the database credentials (username, password, and database name) from the `demo-db` Secret into the container's environment variables. It also defines liveness, readiness, and startup probes to ensure the health and availability of the PostgreSQL database container.",
