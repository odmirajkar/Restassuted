  "file_summary": "This Kubernetes YAML configuration file orchestrates the deployment and management of a PostgreSQL database instance named `demo-db` within a Kubernetes cluster. It comprises three distinct resources: a Secret, a Service, and a Deployment.\n\nThe `Secret` resource, `demo-db`, is crucial for securely storing sensitive database connection parameters such as the host, port, database name, username, and password. It is typed as `servicebinding.io/postgresql`, indicating its intent for use with service binding mechanisms.\n\nThe `Service` resource, also named `demo-db`, acts as an internal load balancer, exposing the PostgreSQL database on port 5432 within the cluster. It directs traffic to pods labeled with `app: demo-db`.\n\nFinally, the `Deployment` resource, `demo-db`, is responsible for deploying and managing the PostgreSQL container. It uses the `postgres:17.5` Docker image. Environment variables for the PostgreSQL user, password, and database name are dynamically fetched from the `demo-db` Secret, promoting secure credential management. The deployment also defines port 5432 for the container and includes robust `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe` configurations using TCP sockets. These probes ensure the database container is healthy, ready to serve requests, and starts up correctly, enhancing the reliability of the database deployment. In essence, this file provides a complete, self-contained definition for deploying a secure and robust PostgreSQL database in Kubernetes.",
