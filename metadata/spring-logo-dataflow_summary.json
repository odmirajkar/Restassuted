One icon is a distinctive green leaf, commonly associated with the Spring Framework. The other icon is a green leaf enclosed within a cloud shape, which is often used to represent Spring Cloud or cloud-native applications built with Spring. Since the input is binary image data and not source code or text, it is not possible to provide a summary of its purpose as a program, nor can any code-specific attributes, functions, or dependent classes be extracted.",
