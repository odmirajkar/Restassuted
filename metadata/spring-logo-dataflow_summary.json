My functionality is limited to processing **plain text**. To provide a summary of a file, you must paste the actual text content of that file (e.g., Java code, a configuration file, a text document, etc.) directly into the chat.

Since I cannot process the image as a file, I cannot generate the requested summary. Here is the standard JSON indicating the issue:

```json
{
  "file_name": "unknown_file",
  "file_path": "unknown_path",
  "file_summary": "The provided content was an image, not a text-based file. I need the actual text content of the file (e.g., Java code, configuration file, etc.) to generate a summary. Please paste the file contents as text.",
  "attributes": [],
  "functions": []
