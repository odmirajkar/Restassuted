  "file_summary": "This document outlines the necessary steps to configure and run the Spring PetClinic sample application using a PostgreSQL database. It provides a quick guide for developers to set up the database environment and activate the correct Spring profile. The instructions primarily focus on two main actions: first, utilizing Docker Compose to initiate the PostgreSQL database container, which ensures the database system is up and running and owned by the 'postgres' user. Second, it guides the user on how to launch the Spring PetClinic application by activating the 'postgres' Spring profile. An example command using Maven (`mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres`) is provided to illustrate how to set this system property and connect the application to the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance. This document serves as a basic operational guide for integrating the application with a PostgreSQL backend.",
