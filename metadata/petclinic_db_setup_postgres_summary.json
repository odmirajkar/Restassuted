  "file_summary": "This file provides setup instructions for configuring the Spring PetClinic sample application to use PostgreSQL as its database. It outlines two main steps: first, it instructs the user to start the PostgreSQL database container using `docker-compose up` from the project's root directory. Second, it explains how to activate the 'postgres' Spring profile when running the application, typically by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property. An example command using `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres` is provided to illustrate how to launch the application with the specified profile, thereby connecting it to the PostgreSQL database.",
