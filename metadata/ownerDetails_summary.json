  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template, commonly used in Spring applications like Spring PetClinic, designed to display comprehensive details about a specific owner, along with information about all their registered pets and their respective visits. It utilizes a shared layout fragment (`fragments/layout`) to ensure a consistent application-wide design, specifically for the 'owners' section. The page prominently displays the owner's basic information (name, address, city, telephone) in a structured table. It also includes conditional display areas for success and error messages, which are set to automatically hide after 3 seconds using a simple JavaScript snippet. A significant part of the page is dedicated to listing each of the owner's pets. For each pet, its name, birth date, and type are shown. Nested within each pet's section is a table detailing all their recorded visits, including the visit date and description. The template provides various navigation links: to edit the current owner, add a new pet for the owner, edit an existing pet, and add a new visit for a specific pet. All text labels are internationalized using Thymeleaf's message expressions (e.g., `#{name}`, `#{address}`).",
