  "file summary": "This HTML document is a Thymeleaf template designed to display comprehensive details of a single owner and their associated pets and visits. It integrates with a common application layout (`fragments/layout`) to ensure consistent presentation and is specifically for the 'owners' section.\n\nThe page prominently features an 'Owner Information' section, presenting the owner's full name, address, city, and telephone number in a structured table. It also includes dynamic message display areas, showing `success` or `error` messages if they are passed to the template. These messages are automatically hidden after a few seconds by an embedded JavaScript function.\n\nKey navigation links are provided, allowing users to 'Edit Owner' details or 'Add New Pet' to the current owner. Following the owner's details, there's a dedicated 'Pets and Visits' section. This section iterates through each pet belonging to the owner, displaying their name, birth date, and type. For each pet, it further lists all recorded visits, showing the visit date and a description. Within this section, links are available to 'Edit Pet' details or 'Add Visit' for a specific pet. The template uses Thymeleaf's internationalization (`#{...}`) and date formatting capabilities (`#temporals.format`) for localized and properly formatted content.",
