  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template designed to display detailed information about a specific pet owner, their associated pets, and each pet's visits. It leverages Thymeleaf's server-side rendering capabilities to populate dynamic content from a 'owner' object. The page presents the owner's personal details (name, address, city, telephone) and dynamically renders success or error messages. A key feature is the display of all pets owned by the individual, showing each pet's name, birth date, and type. For every pet, a nested table lists their historical visits, including the date and description. The template provides action links and buttons, enabling users to edit owner details, add new pets, edit existing pet information, and add new visits for specific pets. It also includes a client-side JavaScript snippet to automatically hide success/error messages after a short delay, improving user experience.",
