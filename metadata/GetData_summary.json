  "file_summary": "This Java class, `GetData`, serves as a suite for automated API testing of the Ergast F1 API. It leverages TestNG for test execution and Rest-Assured for making HTTP requests and validating responses. The primary purpose is to verify the correctness and integrity of the API's data retrieval capabilities. It includes tests to confirm successful API status codes (200 OK), demonstrate chaining requests by extracting data from one response to parameterize a subsequent call (e.g., retrieving a circuit ID and then verifying its country), and illustrate parameterized testing to validate collection sizes (e.g., checking the number of circuits for a specific season). The class provides clear examples of how to interact with RESTful APIs, parse JSON responses, and apply assertions using Hamcrest matchers and TestNG's Assertions.",
