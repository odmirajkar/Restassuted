  "file_summary": "This Java class, `CacheConfiguration`, is a Spring `@Configuration` component responsible for setting up caching in the PetClinic application. It leverages Spring's JCache support to define and customize caches. Specifically, it enables caching functionality across the application using `@EnableCaching` and provides a `@Bean` for `JCacheManagerCustomizer`. This customizer ensures that a cache named \"vets\" is created upon application startup. Furthermore, the configuration for this \"vets\" cache is set to enable statistics, making it possible to monitor cache usage and performance via JMX. This setup is crucial for optimizing data access by caching frequently retrieved data, such as veterinarian information, thereby improving application responsiveness and reducing database load. The class demonstrates a programmatic approach to JCache configuration within a Spring Boot context.",
