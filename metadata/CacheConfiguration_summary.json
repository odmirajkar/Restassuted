  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the caching configuration for the Spring PetClinic application, specifically targeting JCache API compliant caches. It is a Spring `@Configuration` class that enables caching using `@EnableCaching`. The primary purpose is to programmatically configure the application's caches, particularly creating a cache named \"vets\". It also ensures that statistics are enabled for this cache, making them accessible via JMX, which is useful for monitoring. The configuration highlights the limited options available directly through the JCache standard API, suggesting that more advanced settings (like size limits) would depend on the specific JCache implementation being used.",
