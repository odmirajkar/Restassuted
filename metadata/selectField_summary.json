  "file_summary": "This HTML file defines a reusable Thymeleaf fragment named 'select', intended for generating a dynamic dropdown (select) input field within web forms. The fragment takes three parameters: `label` for the visible label of the select box, `name` to bind the select field to a property in the backend model using `th:field`, and `items` which is a collection used to populate the options of the dropdown list.\n\nThe fragment is designed to integrate with Spring's form validation, dynamically adding `has-error` CSS classes to the surrounding `div` if validation errors exist for the bound field. It also conditionally displays visual feedback (success or error icons) and renders validation error messages using `th:errors`. This makes it a highly flexible and consistent component for building form select elements in a Thymeleaf-based Spring Boot application.",
