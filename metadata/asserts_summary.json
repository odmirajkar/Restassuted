  "file_summary": "This file defines a public class named `asserts` within the `org.testng` package. Currently, the class is completely empty, serving as a placeholder or an incomplete definition. Given its package and name, it was likely intended to contain static assertion methods or utility functions similar to TestNG's `Assert` class, providing a set of helper methods for validating conditions during test execution. However, in its current state, it does not provide any functionality, attributes, or methods. It may represent a starting point for future development or a residual empty file.",
