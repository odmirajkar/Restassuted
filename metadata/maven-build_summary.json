  "file_summary": "This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named 'Java CI with Maven', designed to automate the continuous integration process for a Java project using Maven. The workflow is configured to trigger automatically on 'push' and 'pull_request' events that target the 'main' branch of the repository. It includes a single job called 'build' which executes on an 'ubuntu-latest' environment. The build process involves several key steps: first, it checks out the repository's code; second, it sets up Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17, using the 'adopt' distribution, and optimizes performance by caching Maven dependencies. Finally, it executes the Maven build command './mvnw -B verify'. This command typically compiles the project, runs all defined tests, and prepares the project artifacts, ensuring code quality and successful compilation with every relevant commit or pull request. The workflow aims to provide quick feedback on the project's build status and health.",
