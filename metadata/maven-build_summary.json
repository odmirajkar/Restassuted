  "file_summary": "This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named 'Java CI with Maven'. Its primary objective is to automate the continuous integration process for a Java project that uses Maven as its build tool. The workflow is configured to trigger on every push and pull request to the 'main' branch, ensuring that all code changes are validated. It executes on an Ubuntu-latest runner and sets up Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 using the 'adopt' distribution, with Maven dependency caching enabled to optimize build times. The core step involves running the Maven wrapper command (`./mvnw -B verify`) to build the project, execute tests, and perform other verification tasks. This automation helps maintain code quality and provides rapid feedback on changes.",
