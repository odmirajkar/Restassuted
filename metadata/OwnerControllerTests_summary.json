  "file_summary": "This Java class, `OwnerControllerTests`, is a comprehensive test suite for the `OwnerController` in the Spring PetClinic application. It utilizes Spring Boot's `@WebMvcTest` annotation to focus on testing the web layer, specifically the interactions between HTTP requests and the controller. The tests employ `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests (GET and POST) and assert the expected outcomes, such as HTTP status codes, model attributes, and view names. It also uses `@MockitoBean` to mock the `OwnerRepository`, allowing for controlled testing of various scenarios without hitting a real database. The test cases cover a wide range of functionalities including initializing and processing forms for creating and updating owners, searching for owners by last name (both successful and no-results scenarios), and displaying individual owner details. The class includes setup methods to pre-configure mock data before each test and validates form submissions, error handling, and data redirection.",
