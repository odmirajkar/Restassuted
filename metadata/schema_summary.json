  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the complete relational database schema for an application, likely a pet clinic or veterinary management system. The script begins by including `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements for all tables, ensuring that any existing tables with the same names are removed before recreation. This makes the script idempotent and safe to run multiple times without errors. Following the cleanup, it proceeds to create seven distinct tables:\n\n1.  **vets**: Stores information about veterinarians (ID, first name, last name).\n2.  **specialties**: Defines different medical specialties (ID, name).\n3.  **vet_specialties**: A junction table linking vets to their specialties, establishing a many-to-many relationship.\n4.  **types**: Catalogs different types of pets (e.g., cat, dog) (ID, name).\n5.  **owners**: Holds details about pet owners (ID, first name, last name, address, city, telephone).\n6.  **pets**: Contains information about individual pets (ID, name, birth date, type, owner).\n7.  **visits**: Records appointments and medical visits for pets (ID, visit date, description, pet).\n\nCrucially, the script also defines primary keys, creates indexes on frequently queried columns (like last names and names) to optimize performance, and establishes foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity between the tables. This schema forms the foundational data structure for the application, ensuring data consistency and enabling efficient data retrieval.",
