  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the database schema for a 'Pet Clinic' application. It includes `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements for several core entities: `vets` (veterinarians), `specialties` (medical specializations), `types` (categories of pets like dog, cat), `owners` (pet owners), `pets` (the animals themselves), and `visits` (records of pet visits to the clinic). The script also establishes relationships between these tables using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, such as `vet_specialties` linking vets to their specialties, and `pets` referencing `types` and `owners`. Each table includes an auto-incrementing `id` as its primary key. Furthermore, it creates various `INDEX`es on common lookup fields (like `last_name` for vets and owners, `name` for specialties and types, `pet_id` for visits) to optimize query performance.",
