  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the entire database schema for a pet clinic application. It begins by dropping existing tables if they exist (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`) to ensure a clean slate, preventing errors when recreating the schema. Following the drop statements, it systematically creates seven tables: 'vets' (for veterinarians), 'specialties' (for medical specializations), 'vet_specialties' (a join table linking vets to their specialties), 'types' (for different pet types), 'owners' (for pet owners), 'pets' (for pet information), and 'visits' (for records of pet visits). Each `CREATE TABLE` statement specifies column names, data types (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE), and defines primary keys. Furthermore, it establishes relationships between tables using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints and improves query performance by creating `INDEX`es on frequently searched columns, such as last names and IDs.",
