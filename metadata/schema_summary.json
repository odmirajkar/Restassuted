  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the database schema for a 'Pet Clinic' application, creating a set of interrelated tables. It uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements to ensure idempotence. The schema includes tables for `vets` (veterinarian information with first name, last name), `specialties` (types of medical specializations), and a `vet_specialties` join table to link vets to their respective specialties using foreign keys. Additionally, there are tables for `types` (categories of pets), `owners` (owner details including address and phone), `pets` (information about each pet, linking to its type and owner via foreign keys), and `visits` (records of clinic visits for pets, including date and description, linked to the `pets` table). All tables use the InnoDB engine and define appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for efficient data retrieval.",
