  "file_summary": "This SQL DDL script defines the relational database schema for a pet clinic management system. It establishes seven core tables: `vets` to store veterinarian information, `specialties` for different medical areas, and a `vet_specialties` join table to link vets to their specializations. `types` enumerates various pet kinds, while `owners` records owner details. The `pets` table holds individual pet information, referencing both pet `types` and their `owners`. Finally, `visits` logs each pet's medical appointments. The script includes primary keys, foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity, and several `CREATE INDEX` statements to optimize query performance on frequently accessed columns like last names, names, and foreign keys, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management within the application.",
