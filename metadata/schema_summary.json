  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the complete database schema for a veterinary clinic management system. It begins by dropping all existing tables (`vet_specialties`, `vets`, `specialties`, `visits`, `pets`, `types`, `owners`) to ensure a clean slate, preventing errors if the script is run multiple times. The script then proceeds to create seven core tables with appropriate columns and data types. These tables include `vets` for veterinarian details, `specialties` for medical specializations, and `vet_specialties` to link vets with their specialties. It also defines `types` for different animal types, `owners` for pet owner information, `pets` to store pet details linked to owners and types, and `visits` to record appointments and their descriptions linked to specific pets. Each table is designed with a primary key, and multiple foreign key constraints are established to maintain data integrity and relationships between tables, such as pets belonging to owners and having a specific type, and visits being associated with pets. Additionally, indexes are created on key columns (like last names, names, and pet IDs) to optimize query performance for common search operations. This schema provides a robust foundation for managing all essential data within a veterinary practice application."
