  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the complete database schema for a pet clinic application, designed for PostgreSQL. It includes the creation of seven distinct tables, each with a primary key that auto-increments using `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`. The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that the tables are only created if they do not already exist, making the script idempotent and safe to run multiple times without errors. The script meticulously sets up relationships between tables using foreign keys, such as `vet_specialties` linking `vets` and `specialties`, `pets` linking to `types` and `owners`, and `visits` linking to `pets`.\n\nSpecifically, it creates:\n- `vets`: Stores veterinarian information.\n- `specialties`: Lists medical specialties.\n- `vet_specialties`: A many-to-many join table connecting vets to their specialties, with a unique constraint to prevent duplicate assignments.\n- `types`: Defines various pet types (e.g., dog, cat).\n- `owners`: Contains owner details.\n- `pets`: Stores pet information, linking to their type and owner.\n- `visits`: Records appointments and their descriptions for pets.\n\nAdditionally, the script includes `CREATE INDEX` statements on relevant columns (like `last_name` for `vets` and `owners`, `name` for `specialties` and `types`, and `owner_id` for `pets`) to improve query performance on frequently searched fields.",
