  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the relational database schema for a pet clinic application. It begins by dropping all existing tables to ensure a clean slate, then proceeds to create seven distinct tables: `vets`, `specialties`, `vet_specialties`, `types`, `owners`, `pets`, and `visits`. The `vets` table stores information about veterinarians, while `specialties` lists their areas of expertise. `vet_specialties` acts as a many-to-many join table linking vets to their specialties. The `types` table categorizes different kinds of pets (e.g., cat, dog). `owners` holds details about pet owners, including their contact information. `pets` stores individual pet records, linking them to their owners and types. Finally, the `visits` table records each visit a pet makes, including the date and a description. The script establishes primary keys for each main entity table and defines foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity between related tables (e.g., `pets` to `owners` and `types`, `visits` to `pets`, and `vet_specialties` to `vets` and `specialties`). Several indexes are also created on common lookup fields (like `last_name`, `name`, `pet_id`) to optimize query performance. This schema provides a foundational structure for managing data related to veterinary operations.",
