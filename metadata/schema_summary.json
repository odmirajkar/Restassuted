  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the database schema for a pet clinic application. It creates several tables and establishes relationships between them using foreign keys. The tables include `vets` to store veterinarian information, `specialties` for medical specializations, and a `vet_specialties` join table to link vets to their specialties. `types` categorizes pet types, `owners` holds client details, and `pets` stores information about the animals, linking them to owners and types. Finally, `visits` records details of each pet's visit to the clinic. Each table includes an auto-incrementing primary key and relevant columns with appropriate data types and indexes for efficient data retrieval.",
