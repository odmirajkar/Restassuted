  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the complete database schema for a pet clinic management system. It establishes seven core tables: `vets` for veterinarian details, `specialties` for medical specializations, and `vet_specialties` to link vets with their expertise. It also includes `types` for categorizing pets, `owners` to store client information, and `pets` to register animal patients, linking them to their owners and types. Finally, the `visits` table records all clinic appointments and their descriptions. The schema incorporates `PRIMARY KEY` constraints for unique identification, `FOREIGN KEY` relationships to maintain data integrity across tables (e.g., `pets` referencing `owners` and `types`, `visits` referencing `pets`, and `vet_specialties` referencing `vets` and `specialties`), and `UNIQUE` constraints where applicable. Additionally, various `CREATE INDEX` statements are included on key columns like last names, names, and IDs to optimize data retrieval performance. This DDL script forms the foundational data model for a comprehensive pet clinic application, enabling the storage and management of critical operational data."
