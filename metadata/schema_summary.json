  "file summary": "This SQL file is responsible for defining the complete database schema for a veterinary clinic application. It begins by dropping all existing tables (`vet_specialties`, `vets`, `specialties`, `visits`, `pets`, `types`, `owners`) if they exist, ensuring a clean and consistent database state. Following this, it systematically creates each table, specifying column names, data types (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE), and primary key constraints. It also defines indexes on frequently queried columns (like last names and names) to optimize database performance. Crucially, the script establishes relationships between tables by adding foreign key constraints (e.g., linking pets to owners and types, and visits to pets), which ensures data integrity and consistency across the database. This script is foundational for setting up the database structure before populating it with data.",
