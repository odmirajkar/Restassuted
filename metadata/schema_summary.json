  "file_summary": "This SQL script defines the database schema for a pet clinic application, establishing the structure of various tables and their relationships. It creates seven tables: `vets` to store details about veterinarians; `specialties` for different medical areas; `vet_specialties` to link veterinarians with their specializations; `types` for different animal species (e.g., cat, dog); `owners` to hold customer information; `pets` to store details about individual animals, including their type and owner; and `visits` to record appointments and medical procedures for pets. Each table includes primary keys, and relevant tables utilize foreign keys to establish relationships, such as `pets` linking to `owners` and `types`, and `visits` linking to `pets`. The schema also includes indexes to optimize data retrieval, particularly on `last_name` for `vets` and `owners`, and `name` for `specialties` and `types`.",
