  "file_summary": "This document details the Apache License, Version 2.0, a widely adopted permissive free software license from the Apache Software Foundation. Its core purpose is to establish the terms and conditions governing the use, reproduction, and distribution of software and other works. The license grants broad permissions to users, allowing them to reproduce, create derivative works, publicly display, perform, sublicense, and distribute the licensed material in both source and object forms. These rights are granted worldwide, perpetually, and royalty-free.\n\nKey obligations for redistribution include providing a copy of this license, clearly indicating any modifications made, and retaining all original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices. It explicitly includes a patent license grant for contributions, which can be terminated if the licensee initiates patent litigation against the Work. The license also features a strong disclaimer of warranty, stating the work is provided \"AS IS\" without any express or implied warranties, and includes a limitation of liability for contributors. It clarifies that any contributions submitted to a licensor for inclusion in a work under Apache 2.0 will inherently fall under these same terms. The appendix provides guidance on how to apply the license to new works.",
