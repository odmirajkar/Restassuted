  "file_summary": "This CSS file defines the styling rules for a navigation bar component within a web application. It sets the overall appearance of the `.navbar` element, including its background color, borders, and margins. Key styling points include the `navbar-brand` (logo), which uses a background image and implements a hover effect to transition its opacity. Navigation links and text (`.navbar li > a`, `.navbar-text`) are styled with specific font families, sizes, padding, and an uppercase text transformation for links. A hover effect is also applied to navigation links, changing their background and text colors. Additionally, the file styles the `.navbar-toggle` element, commonly used for responsive mobile navigation, by defining the dimensions and spacing of its `icon-bar` components.",
