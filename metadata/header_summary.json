  "file_summary": "This CSS file is responsible for styling the navigation bar (`.navbar`) of a web application, providing a distinct visual identity. It defines the layout and appearance of the `.navbar` element, including its top border, background color, and margin. A prominent feature is the `.navbar-brand` styling, which incorporates the 'spring-logo-dataflow.png' image and implements a subtle hover effect by manipulating opacity. The file also customizes the appearance of navigation links (`.navbar li > a`) and plain text within the navbar (`.navbar-text`), applying specific fonts, text transformations (uppercase), padding, and transition effects for smooth hover interactions where the background changes to a distinct green (`#6db33f`). Furthermore, it includes styles for the `navbar-toggle` button, typically used in mobile views, defining the dimensions of its icon bars. The overall design suggests a branding consistent with 'Spring Data Flow,' characterized by dark tones and green accents.",
