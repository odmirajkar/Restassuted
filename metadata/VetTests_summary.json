  "file_summary": "This Java file contains a unit test for the `Vet` model class. Its primary purpose is to verify the serializability of the `Vet` object. The `testSerialization()` method creates a `Vet` instance, populates its properties, serializes it into a byte array, then deserializes it back into a new `Vet` object. Finally, it asserts that the properties (first name, last name, and ID) of the deserialized `Vet` object match those of the original object, ensuring that the serialization and deserialization process works correctly without data loss or corruption.",
