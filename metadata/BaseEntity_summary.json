  "file_summary": "This `BaseEntity` class serves as a fundamental base class for domain objects within the Spring PetClinic application. It is designed to provide a common `id` property, which is essential for most persistent entities. Marked with `@MappedSuperclass`, it indicates that its persistent properties should be inherited by concrete entity classes that extend it, but it is not an entity itself. The `id` field is annotated with `@Id` for primary key identification and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` to signify that the database will automatically generate its value. The class also implements `Serializable`, allowing its instances to be converted into a byte stream. It includes standard getter and setter methods for the `id` and a utility method `isNew()` to determine if the entity has not yet been persisted (i.e., its `id` is null).",
