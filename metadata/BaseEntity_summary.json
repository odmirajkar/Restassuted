  "file_summary": "The `BaseEntity` class serves as a fundamental abstract base class within the Spring PetClinic application's domain model. Its primary purpose is to provide a common `id` property for various domain objects that require a unique identifier for persistence. By being annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`, it signifies that its mapping information (specifically the `id` field) will be inherited by its subclasses, but `BaseEntity` itself will not be mapped to a database table. The `id` field, an `Integer`, is marked with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`, ensuring that it acts as the primary key and is automatically generated by the database upon insertion. The class includes standard getter (`getId()`) and setter (`setId(Integer id)`) methods for the `id` property. Furthermore, it provides a utility method `isNew()`, which conveniently checks if an entity instance is new (i.e., not yet persisted) by evaluating if its `id` is null. Implementing `Serializable` allows instances of this class and its subclasses to be serialized, which is often required in distributed environments or for caching.",
