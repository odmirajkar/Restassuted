  "file_summary": "The `BaseEntity` class serves as an abstract base class for other domain objects within the Spring PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to provide a common identifier (`id`) property for entities, simplifying persistence operations. Annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`, it indicates that its properties should be inherited by concrete entity classes without `BaseEntity` itself being a persistent entity. The `id` field is configured as the primary key using `@Id` and is set to be automatically generated using `GenerationType.IDENTITY`. The class also includes standard getter and setter methods for the `id` and a utility method `isNew()` to determine if an entity instance has not yet been persisted (i.e., its `id` is null). It implements `Serializable` for potential serialization needs.",
