  "file_summary": "This `BaseEntity` class serves as a fundamental base class for other domain objects within the Spring Framework PetClinic sample application. Its primary purpose is to provide a common `id` property for entities, simplifying object management and persistence. The class uses Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) annotations, specifically `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`, to mark the `id` field as the primary key and configure it for auto-generation by the database. It also implements `Serializable`, making instances capable of being serialized. The class includes basic getter and setter methods for the `id`, along with a utility method `isNew()` to determine if the entity has not yet been persisted (i.e., its `id` is null). This design promotes code reusability and ensures consistent ID handling across various entities.",
