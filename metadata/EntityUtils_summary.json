  "file_summary": "The `EntityUtils` class is an abstract utility class designed to provide helpful methods for managing and retrieving `BaseEntity` objects within a collection. Its primary purpose is to simplify common tasks like looking up an entity by its ID and class type. It is specifically separated from the `BaseEntity` class due to its dependency on `ObjectRetrievalFailureException`, an ORM-specific exception from Spring's ORM module. This class centralizes entity lookup logic, ensuring consistency and handling cases where an entity is not found by throwing an `ObjectRetrievalFailureException`.",
