  "file_summary": "This Java file defines `EntityUtils`, an abstract utility class within the Spring PetClinic application's service layer. Its primary purpose is to provide helper methods for working with `BaseEntity` objects, particularly for retrieving specific entities from a collection based on their ID. The class contains a single static, generic method, `getById`, which iterates through a given collection of entities and attempts to find an entity that matches both the specified ID and entity class. This utility is crucial for efficiently locating objects in memory-based collections. If an entity matching the criteria is not found, the method throws an `ObjectRetrievalFailureException`, indicating that the requested entity could not be retrieved. The design of this class is separate from `BaseEntity` itself due to its dependency on ORM-associated exceptions, ensuring a cleaner separation of concerns between core model entities and utility logic.",
