  "file_summary": "This file defines the `EntityUtils` abstract class, which serves as a utility class providing helper methods for working with entities that extend `BaseEntity`. Its primary purpose is to offer a static method `getById` that can look up a specific entity within a given collection based on its ID and class type. This utility is crucial for retrieving specific objects from collections, especially in contexts where entities are managed by an ORM. If an entity with the specified ID and class is not found in the collection, the method throws an `ObjectRetrievalFailureException`, indicating that the requested entity could not be located. The class is kept separate from `BaseEntity` specifically because of its dependency on this ORM-related exception.",
