  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file specifically designed for localization in a Java application, likely a Spring-based one like PetClinic. It serves as the German (de) translation of the application's user interface text, messages, and labels. Its primary purpose is to provide an internationalized version of the application's textual content, allowing the application to display information in German when the locale is set accordingly. The file consists of key-value pairs where the keys are consistent identifiers across different language files, and the values are their corresponding German translations. The content covers a wide range of UI elements, including general application messages like \"Willkommen\" (Welcome) and \"Fehler\" (Error), and specific validation messages such as \"muss angegeben werden\" (required) and \"ung체ltiges Datum\" (invalid date). It also includes localized labels for entities like \"Besitzer\" (Owner), \"Haustier\" (Pet), \"Tier채rzte\" (Veterinarians), and their attributes like \"Vorname\" (First Name), \"Adresse\" (Address), \"Geburtsdatum\" (Birth Date). Furthermore, it translates action-oriented labels and navigation elements such as \"Besitzer hinzuf체gen\" (Add Owner), \"Haustier bearbeiten\" (Edit Pet), \"Startseite\" (Home), and pagination terms like \"Erste\" (First) and \"N채chste\" (Next). This file is crucial for delivering a localized user experience to German-speaking users, centralizing all German text strings for easy maintenance and updates without altering the core application code.",
