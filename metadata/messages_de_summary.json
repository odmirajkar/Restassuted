  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, specifically tailored for internationalization (i18n) to provide German (de) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It serves as a resource bundle, mapping keys to their corresponding German translations for various user interface elements, form fields, navigation labels, and validation messages. The content is a direct German translation of common labels found in a PetClinic application, including terms related to 'Besitzer' (Owner), 'Haustiere' (Pets), 'Tier채rzte' (Veterinarians), and 'Besuche' (Visits). It covers form elements like 'Vorname' (First Name), 'Nachname' (Last Name), 'Adresse' (Address), and 'Telefon' (Telephone), along with actions such as 'Besitzer hinzuf체gen' (Add Owner), 'Haustier bearbeiten' (Edit Pet), and 'Besuch hinzuf체gen' (Add Visit). Critical validation and error messages, like 'muss angegeben werden' (is required) and 'ung체ltiges Datum' (invalid date), are also included. This file ensures that the application's user interface can be displayed in German, providing a localized experience for users who prefer this language.",
