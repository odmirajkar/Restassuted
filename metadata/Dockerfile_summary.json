  "file summary": "This Dockerfile defines a development environment, primarily tailored for Java projects, suitable for use with devcontainers (like VS Code Dev Containers) or Gitpod. It is based on a Microsoft VS Code devcontainer image for Java, specifically using a Debian Bullseye variant. The Dockerfile allows for customization of the Java version to be installed via SDKMAN, ensuring a specific JVM is used. It also includes an optional step to install a specified Node.js version using NVM (Node Version Manager), making it suitable for polyglot projects. A crucial part of this configuration is the setup of persistent volumes for Maven (`.m2`) and Gradle (`.gradle`) caches. This ensures that downloaded dependencies and build artifacts are retained across container rebuilds or restarts, significantly speeding up subsequent builds. The Dockerfile handles directory creation and permission setting for these cache volumes for the 'vscode' user. The overall purpose is to provide a consistent, pre-configured, and performance-optimized development environment for Java applications, with support for Node.js and efficient dependency management.",
