  "file_summary": "This Dockerfile defines a Docker image based on Ubuntu 16.04, designed for building and testing Java Maven projects. Its primary purpose is to create an isolated environment capable of cloning a Git repository and executing its Maven tests. The build process begins by updating the package manager's lists and then installs essential software components: `default-jre`, `default-jdk`, `git`, and `maven`. After these installations, the Dockerfile verifies the Maven version to ensure it's correctly set up. It then clones the 'Devops-POC/Rest-Assured' Git repository into the image. Finally, it navigates into the cloned 'Rest-Assured' directory and runs `mvn test`, which executes all unit and integration tests defined within that project. The redundant `CMD ls` instructions are noted, as only the last `CMD` instruction would take effect as the default command when a container is launched from this image without an explicit command.",
