  "file_summary": "This Dockerfile defines a development container environment primarily for Java projects, built upon a base Microsoft VS Code dev container image for Java. It allows for the customization of the Java variant and optionally includes Node.js installation if a specific version is provided. Key features include the declaration of persistent volumes for Maven (`.m2`) and Gradle (`.gradle`) caches, which helps in speeding up builds and managing dependencies across container restarts. The Dockerfile also ensures that specific directories for these caches are created and have the correct ownership. Furthermore, it explicitly installs and sets a particular Java Development Kit (JDK) version, defaulting to 17.0.7-ms, using SDKMAN. This ensures a consistent and controlled Java environment, making it suitable for projects that require a precise JDK version. The overall purpose is to provide a reproducible and pre-configured workspace for Java development.",
