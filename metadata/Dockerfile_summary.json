"file summary":"This Dockerfile defines the build instructions for a development container environment primarily tailored for Java projects. It extends from a Microsoft VS Code Dev Container base image for Java, configured with a specified Java variant (defaulting to `17-bullseye`). The core purpose is to establish a consistent and reproducible development setup by installing a specific Java Development Kit (JDK) version, which defaults to `17.0.7-ms`, leveraging SDKMAN for efficient version management. Additionally, the Dockerfile includes an optional capability to install a specified Node.js version using NVM, accommodating projects with frontend components or Node.js dependencies. It also declares volumes for common build tool caches, specifically for Maven (`.m2`) and Gradle (`.gradle`), and ensures proper directory creation and ownership for these caches. This configuration aims to improve developer experience and build performance by persisting dependencies and build outputs across container sessions. The file is designed for use within development environments such as devcontainers or Gitpod, providing all necessary prerequisites for Java application development.",
