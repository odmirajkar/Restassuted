  "file_summary": "This file serves as a .gitignore configuration, specifying files and directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes in a project repository. Its primary purpose is to keep the repository clean by excluding generated files, build artifacts, IDE-specific configuration files, and temporary assets that are not essential for version control. It includes common ignore patterns for Maven (`target/`, `pom.xml.bak`), Gradle (`build/`), various IDEs like STS (`.classpath`, `.project`, `bin/`), IntelliJ IDEA (`.idea`, `out/`), NetBeans (`nbproject/`), and VS Code (`.vscode/`). It also ignores SDK Man configuration (`.sdkmanrc`) and general CSS files (`*.css`) with a specific exception for `petclinic.css`, ensuring that this particular stylesheet is tracked. This setup prevents unnecessary files from being committed, streamlines collaboration, and maintains a focused codebase.",
