  "file_summary": "This file is an EditorConfig configuration file that defines consistent coding styles for various file types within a project. It ensures that all developers adhere to the same formatting rules, regardless of the editor or IDE they use. The configuration sets global rules for character encoding (UTF-8), line endings (LF), and ensuring a final newline. It also specifies indentation styles and sizes for specific file types: Java and XML files use 4-space indentation; 'pom' and 'wro' XML files use 2-space indentation; HTML, SQL, and LESS files use 2-space indentation; and Gradle files also use 2-space indentation. This helps maintain code readability and consistency across the entire codebase.",
