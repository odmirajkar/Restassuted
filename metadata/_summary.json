  "file_summary": "This file serves as an EditorConfig configuration, which helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs for multiple developers working on a project. It defines various formatting rules that editors supporting EditorConfig will automatically apply. The configuration starts by setting `root = true`, indicating it's the top-most EditorConfig file for the project. Global settings `[*]` apply to all file types, enforcing UTF-8 character encoding, Unix-style line endings (`lf`), ensuring a final newline at the end of files, and using spaces for indentation. Specific overrides are then defined for different file groups. For `.java` and `.xml` files, it mandates a `tab` indentation style with a size of 4 and enables trimming of trailing whitespace. Further specific rules are applied to `{pom,wro}.xml` files, overriding to `space` indentation with a size of 2. Finally, `.html`, `.sql`, `.less`, and `.gradle` files are all configured to use an indent size of 2.",
