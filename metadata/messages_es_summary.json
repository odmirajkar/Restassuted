  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, commonly used in Java applications for externalizing and localizing user interface text, messages, and labels. Specifically, this file contains the Spanish (es) translations for the PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to enable internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to display its content in Spanish when the user's locale is set accordingly. The file comprises a collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a corresponding Spanish string. The content covers a wide array of application messages, including general welcome and error messages like \"Bienvenido\" (Welcome) and \"Error\", as well as validation messages such as \"Es requerido\" (is required), \"Fecha invalida\" (invalid date), and \"El número de teléfono debe tener 10 dígitos\" (Telephone must be a 10-digit number). It also defines labels for various entities and their attributes within the application, such as \"Propietario\" (Owner), \"Mascota\" (Pet), \"Nombre\" (Name), \"Dirección\" (Address), and \"Fecha de nacimiento\" (Birth Date). Furthermore, it provides Spanish labels for navigation elements and actions, including \"Añadir propietario\" (Add Owner), \"Buscar propietario\" (Find Owner), \"Editar mascota\" (Edit Pet), \"Inicio\" (Home), and pagination terms like \"Primero\" (First) and \"Siguiente\" (Next). This file is essential for providing a fully localized user experience for Spanish-speaking users of the application.",
