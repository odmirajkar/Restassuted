  "file_summary": "This file is a standard Java properties file, designed for internationalization (i18n) to provide Spanish (es) localized text strings for a PetClinic-like application. It functions as a resource bundle, mapping various keys to their corresponding Spanish translations, which are used for user interface labels, form field names, button texts, navigation links, and validation messages. The content clearly indicates its purpose within a PetClinic application, as evidenced by entries like 'Propietario' (Owner), 'Mascota' (Pet), and 'Veterinarios' (Veterinarians). It includes common form attributes such as 'Nombre' (First Name), 'Apellido' (Last Name), 'Dirección' (Address), and 'Teléfono' (Telephone), along with actions like 'Añadir propietario' (Add Owner), 'Editar mascota' (Edit Pet), and 'Agregar visita' (Add Visit). Furthermore, it provides localized error and validation messages, such as 'Es requerido' (is required) and 'Fecha invalida' (invalid date). This file is crucial for delivering a fully localized user experience in Spanish for the application.",
