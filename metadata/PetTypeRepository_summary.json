  "file_summary": "The `PetTypeRepository` interface serves as the data access layer for `PetType` domain objects within the Spring PetClinic application. It extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository`, automatically providing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for `PetType` entities, which are identified by their `Integer` ID.\n\nIn addition to the methods inherited from `JpaRepository`, this interface defines one custom query method:\n- `findPetTypes()`: This method is annotated with a JPA `@Query` to retrieve all `PetType` entities from the data store, ordered alphabetically by their `name`. This ensures that pet types are consistently presented in a sorted manner. This repository effectively abstracts the database interactions required to manage and retrieve different categories of pets.",
