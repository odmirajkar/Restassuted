  "file_summary": "This Java interface, `PetTypeRepository`, serves as a Spring Data JPA repository designed for managing `PetType` entities within the PetClinic application. It extends `JpaRepository<PetType, Integer>`, which automatically provides a comprehensive set of standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with functionalities for pagination and sorting for `PetType` objects, identified by their `Integer` primary key. Its primary purpose is to facilitate seamless interaction with the underlying data store for retrieving, persisting, and querying pet type information. The repository also defines a custom query method, `findPetTypes()`, which specifically retrieves all `PetType` instances from the database, ordered alphabetically by their name, thus offering tailored data retrieval logic beyond the generic capabilities inherited from `JpaRepository`. This makes it a central component for data access related to pet types.",
