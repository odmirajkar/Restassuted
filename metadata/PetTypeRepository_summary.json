  "file_summary": "This Java interface, `PetTypeRepository`, serves as a Spring Data JPA repository for managing `PetType` domain objects within the PetClinic application. It extends Spring's `JpaRepository`, inheriting standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and pagination capabilities for `PetType` entities, identified by an `Integer` ID. The primary purpose of this repository is to abstract the data access layer for pet types. In addition to the inherited functionalities, it provides a custom query method, `findPetTypes()`, which specifically retrieves all `PetType` entities from the data store, ordered alphabetically by their names. This ensures that pet types are consistently presented in a sorted manner across the application.",
