  "file_summary": "This Java class, `Specialty`, is a core component of the Spring PetClinic application, designed to represent specific areas of expertise for veterinarians, such as 'dentistry' or 'radiology'. It extends the `NamedEntity` class, inheriting common properties like an `id` and a `name`, which holds the description of the specialty. Annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"specialties\")`, it signifies its role as a persistent entity in the database, mapping directly to a `specialties` table. Its primary purpose is to categorize and define the distinct services or focuses a `Vet` can have, enabling the system to manage and display veterinarian specializations effectively within the application.",
