  "file_summary": "This Java class, `Specialty`, located within the `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.vet` package, serves as a JPA entity that models a veterinary specialty, such as 'dentistry'. It extends `NamedEntity`, indicating that it inherits common properties like an `id` and a `name` from its superclass. Annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"specialties\")`, this class is configured to be persisted to the `specialties` table in a relational database. Its primary purpose is to categorize and represent specific areas of expertise that a veterinarian might possess within the PetClinic application. The class itself does not define any new attributes or methods, relying entirely on the `NamedEntity` base class for its core functionality and the JPA annotations for database mapping.",
