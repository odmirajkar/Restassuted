  "file_summary": "This Java class, `Specialty`, models a specific area of expertise or discipline for veterinarians within the Spring PetClinic application. It extends `NamedEntity`, indicating that it possesses a 'name' property, which likely describes the specialty (e.g., \"dentistry\", \"radiology\"). The class is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"specialties\")`, marking it as a JPA entity that maps to the 'specialties' table in the database. Its primary purpose is to define and store the various specialties that can be associated with a `Vet` object, enabling the categorization and filtering of veterinary services.",
