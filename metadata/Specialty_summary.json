  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the `Specialty` class, a core domain entity within the Spring PetClinic application. It models a specific area of expertise or qualification that a veterinarian might possess (e.g., dentistry, radiology). Annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"specialties\")`, it represents a persistent entity mapped to the 'specialties' table in the database. The `Specialty` class extends `NamedEntity`, thereby inheriting common properties such as an `id` and a `name`, which are fundamental for identifying and describing the specialty. This design promotes reusability and a consistent data model for entities that are primarily identified by a name.",
