  "file_summary": "This HTML file, designed with Thymeleaf, provides a user interface for creating and updating pet information. It integrates with a common layout fragment (`fragments/layout`) and is specifically associated with the 'owners' section of the application. The form allows users to input the pet's name and birth date, and select its type from a dropdown list populated dynamically. It displays the associated owner's first and last name, though this field is not editable within the form. A hidden input field manages the pet's ID, crucial for distinguishing between new pet creation and updating an existing one. The form's heading and the submit button text (`'Add Pet'` or `'Update Pet'`) dynamically change based on whether a new pet object is being created or an existing one modified, driven by a `pet['new']` flag. The file makes use of reusable Thymeleaf fragments such as `inputField` and `selectField` for consistent form element rendering. Data submitted from this form is intended to be processed via a POST request, typically handled by a server-side controller.",
