  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template (`petForm.html`) designed for a web application, likely a Spring-based project, to facilitate the creation or updating of pet information. It extends a common layout (`fragments/layout`) ensuring consistent page structure. The page presents a form that allows users to input essential details for a pet, including its name, birth date, and type. It dynamically displays the owner's full name, indicating the pet's association. The form's title and the submit button's text (`Add Pet` or `Update Pet`) adapt based on whether the `pet` object is new or existing. The template leverages Thymeleaf's `th:object` for form binding and utilizes reusable fragments like `inputField` and `selectField` for common form elements, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication. This page serves as a user interface for managing pet entities within the application's data.",
