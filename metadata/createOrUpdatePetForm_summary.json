  "file_summary": "This HTML file, designed with Thymeleaf, serves as a dynamic form for managing pet information within a web application, likely part of a Spring Boot Pet Clinic example. It allows users to either add a new pet or update an existing one. The form prominently displays the pet's owner, leveraging Thymeleaf's `th:text` to show the owner's first and last name. Key input fields include the pet's name, birth date (using a date picker via a fragment), and pet type (rendered as a dropdown select box populated from a list of types). It utilizes reusable Thymeleaf fragments like `fragments/inputField` and `fragments/selectField` for consistent input field rendering. A hidden input field stores the pet's ID, crucial for distinguishing between new pet creation and updating an existing record. The submit button dynamically changes its text ('Add Pet' or 'Update Pet') based on whether the pet object is flagged as 'new'. This page is integrated into a larger layout using `fragments/layout.html` and is specifically associated with the 'owners' section of the application.",
