Furthermore, the `file_name` in the provided JSON is `Jenkinsfile`, and the summary describes a Jenkins pipeline, not a Java class. While I can see you've tried to adapt the `attributes` and `functions` sections to describe a Jenkinsfile's concepts, the core request is to summarize **Java code** and extract Java-specific details like member variables (attributes with types like `private static int`) and methods (functions with return types and parameters).

Since the content describes a `Jenkinsfile` (which uses Groovy for its DSL, not Java for class definitions), I cannot meaningfully apply the Java-specific parts of the JSON structure (e.g., specific Java data types, Java access modifiers for attributes, or Java method signatures for functions).
