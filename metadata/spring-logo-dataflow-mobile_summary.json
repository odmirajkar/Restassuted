It includes a green leaf icon (often associated with Spring Framework) and another green icon that resembles a cloud or a circular shape. Since the input is image data, it cannot be processed as a code file, and therefore, no code-specific summary, attributes, functions, or dependent classes can be extracted. This input is a binary image, likely intended for display.",
