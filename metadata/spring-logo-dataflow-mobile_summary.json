To get a summary, you *must* provide the content of the file as **plain text**. For example, if it's a Java file, copy and paste the Java code directly.

Since I cannot process the image as a file, here's the same basic JSON indicating the issue:

```json
{
  "file_name": "unknown_file",
  "file_path": "unknown_path",
  "file_summary": "The provided content was an image, not a text-based file. I need the actual text content of the file (e.g., Java code, configuration file, etc.) to generate a summary. Please paste the file contents as text.",
  "attributes": [],
  "functions": []
}
