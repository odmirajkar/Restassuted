  "file_summary": "This file contains an image featuring two distinct green logos on a white background. The logo on the left is a stylized green leaf, which is widely recognized as the official logo for the Spring Framework, a prominent open-source application framework for Java. The logo on the right depicts a green stylized cloud shape, including an internal arrow or swirl pattern, commonly associated with cloud computing services, data flow, or specific cloud platforms. The presence of both logos together suggests that this image is likely used as a visual identifier or branding element for applications, services, or documentation that integrate Spring-based technologies with cloud environments, such as those built using Spring Cloud or deployed to various cloud providers. It visually conveys a connection between Java development with Spring and cloud infrastructure."
