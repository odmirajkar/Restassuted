  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template, commonly found in Spring applications like Spring PetClinic, designed to provide a user interface for adding new owner details or updating existing ones. It utilizes a shared layout fragment (`fragments/layout`) to ensure a consistent page structure and styling, specifically tailored for the 'owners' section of the application. The core of the file is a form (`id=\"add-owner-form\"`) that binds to an `owner` object, facilitating data input and submission. The form includes various input fields for owner information such as first name, last name, address, city, and telephone. These fields are rendered dynamically using another Thymeleaf fragment (`fragments/inputField`), promoting modularity and reusability of UI components. Text labels within the form are internationalized using Thymeleaf's message expressions (e.g., `#{firstName}`). A notable feature is the submit button, which intelligently changes its text to either 'Add Owner' or 'Update Owner' based on whether the associated `owner` object is a new entity or an existing one, making the template versatile for both creation and modification workflows. The form uses the POST method to submit data.",
