  "file summary": "This HTML document is a Thymeleaf template, serving as a dynamic web page for managing owner details within an application. It's designed to be included as part of a larger layout (`fragments/layout`) and is specifically for the 'owners' section. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a user interface for either creating a new owner record or updating an existing one.\n\nThe core of the page is an HTML `form` with the ID `add-owner-form`, which submits data using the POST method. This form is bound to an `owner` object, indicating that it interacts with a backend model. It includes several input fields, dynamically rendered using a Thymeleaf fragment (`fragments/inputField`), for capturing essential owner information: `firstName`, `lastName`, `address`, `city`, and `telephone`. These fields are localized using Thymeleaf's internationalization syntax (`#{...}`).\n\nA key feature is the submit button, whose text (`Add Owner` or `Update Owner`) intelligently adapts based on whether the `owner` object being edited is new or pre-existing, determined by the `owner['new']` property. This conditional rendering makes the template versatile for both creation and modification workflows. The page structure also incorporates CSS classes (`form-group`, `has-feedback`, `col-sm-offset-2`, `col-sm-10`, `btn btn-primary`) for styling and layout, suggesting a Bootstrap or similar framework integration.",
