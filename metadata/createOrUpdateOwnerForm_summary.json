  "file_summary": "This HTML file acts as a Thymeleaf template for a web form dedicated to adding or updating owner information within an application. It integrates with a common `fragments/layout` for consistent page structure and utilizes a `fragments/inputField` fragment for rendering various form inputs, including first name, last name, address, city, and telephone. The form dynamically changes its title and the submit button's text (e.g., 'Add Owner' or 'Update Owner') based on whether it's being used to create a new owner record or modify an existing one. It leverages Thymeleaf's internationalization features (`th:text`, `th:replace`) for labels and button texts, ensuring a consistent and localized user experience.",
