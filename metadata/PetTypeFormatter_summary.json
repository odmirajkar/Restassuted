  "file_summary": "The `PetTypeFormatter` class is a Spring `Formatter` implementation designed to convert between `PetType` objects and their String representations. This is crucial for Spring MVC to properly bind and render `PetType` instances in web forms and views. Annotated with `@Component`, it is automatically detected and registered by Spring as a bean. The formatter relies on the `PetTypeRepository` to retrieve `PetType` objects by their name during the parsing process (String to `PetType`).\n\nIts `print` method takes a `PetType` object and returns its name as a String, which is useful for displaying the type in the UI. The `parse` method takes a String (typically from a form submission or URL parameter) and attempts to find a matching `PetType` from the repository based on its name. If no matching `PetType` is found, it throws a `ParseException`, indicating that the input string does not correspond to a valid pet type. This class ensures that `PetType` objects are seamlessly integrated into Spring's data binding and formatting infrastructure.",
