  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template (`visitForm.html`) designed for a web application, likely a Spring-based project, specifically to manage veterinary visits for pets. It extends a common layout (`fragments/layout`) for consistent styling and structure. The page serves two main purposes: displaying details of the current pet (name, birth date, type, and owner) and providing a form to add new visits or update existing visit information. The form allows users to input the visit's date and a description. Below the form, it also lists all previous visits for the displayed pet, showing their date and description. The dynamic title and button text depend on whether a new visit is being created. It leverages Thymeleaf for data binding (`th:object`, `th:value`, `th:text`) and includes reusable input field fragments, promoting a modular and maintainable front-end.",
