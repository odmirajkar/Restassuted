  "file_summary": "This Thymeleaf HTML template is designed to facilitate the addition of new visits for a specific pet, as well as to display a list of previous visits for that pet. It integrates with a Spring Boot application (likely Pet Clinic) to manage pet-related data. The page displays essential pet information such as name, birth date, type, and owner details. It provides a form where users can input the date and a description for a new visit. Additionally, it features a section that lists all previously recorded visits for the pet, showing their date and description, using Thymeleaf's conditional rendering and iteration capabilities. The template also uses internationalization keys (e.g., #{new}, #{pet}) indicating support for multiple languages.",
