  "file_summary": "This HTML file, built with Thymeleaf, serves as a user interface for managing pet visits. Its primary purpose is to allow users to add new visits for a specific pet and to display a list of that pet's previous visits. The page integrates with a common layout (`fragments/layout`) and is part of the 'owners' section of the application. It displays read-only details of the pet (name, birth date, type, and owner) for which the visit is being recorded. The form for adding a new visit includes fields for 'Date' and 'Description', utilizing reusable Thymeleaf input fragments. A hidden input field passes the `pet.id` to the server upon form submission. The 'Add Visit' button dynamically displays text based on a `visit['new']` flag. Below the visit creation form, a table lists all previous visits for the pet, displaying their date and description, with dates formatted for readability.",
