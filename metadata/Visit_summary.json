  "file_summary": "The `Visit` class is a core domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, located in the `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner` package. It represents a single visit by a pet, capturing information about the date of the visit and a description of the visit's purpose or observations. Inheriting from `BaseEntity`, it automatically includes an `id` property for database identification. \n\nAnnotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"visits\")`, `Visit` is configured as a JPA (Java Persistence API) entity, enabling its persistence to a database table named 'visits'. The `date` attribute, storing the visit's date, is mapped to a column named `visit_date` and formatted as `yyyy-MM-dd` for display. The `description` attribute, a string detailing the visit, is marked with `@NotBlank` to ensure it's not empty. The class provides a default constructor that initializes the `date` to the current date and includes standard getter and setter methods for all its properties. This class is fundamental for tracking the historical health and care records of pets.",
