  "file_summary": "The `Visit` class is a core domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, designed to represent a single visit by a pet. Extending `BaseEntity`, it inherits basic entity properties like an ID, making it suitable for persistence. Annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = \"visits\")`, it serves as a JPA entity, mapping directly to the 'visits' table in the underlying database. Key attributes include `date`, a `LocalDate` object capturing when the visit occurred (defaulting to the current date upon creation), and `description`, a `String` providing details about the visit, which is marked as mandatory with `@NotBlank`. The `date` field is also formatted using `@DateTimeFormat` for proper display and input handling. This class provides standard getter and setter methods for its properties, facilitating data access and manipulation within the application's service layer and user interface. Its primary purpose is to model and manage pet visit records.",
