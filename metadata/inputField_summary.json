  "file_summary": "This HTML snippet defines a reusable Thymeleaf fragment named 'input'. Its primary purpose is to generate standard HTML form input fields (specifically text and date types) with built-in styling for Bootstrap 3 (form-group, col-sm-2, col-sm-10, form-control) and integrated Thymeleaf validation feedback. The fragment takes 'label', 'name', and 'type' as parameters. It dynamically sets up the label, input field (bound to a model attribute using 'th:field'), and provides visual cues for validation status (green checkmark for valid, red cross for invalid). If there are validation errors, it displays an error message using 'th:errors'. This fragment is designed to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in web form development by centralizing the rendering logic for common input elements.",
