  "file_summary": "This HTML file contains a reusable Thymeleaf fragment named 'input'. It is designed to render a generic form input field, dynamically adapting its appearance based on validation status. The fragment accepts three parameters: `label` for the input's label, `name` to bind the input to a model field using `th:field`, and `type` to specify the input type (currently supports 'text' and 'date').\n\nThe component dynamically applies CSS classes ('form-group', 'has-error') based on whether the bound field has validation errors, providing visual feedback to the user. It also includes conditional rendering of success/error icons and displays validation error messages using `th:errors` if the field is invalid. This makes it a highly modular and efficient way to create consistent form input elements across a Spring Boot application using Thymeleaf.",
