  "file_summary": "This HTML file defines a reusable Thymeleaf fragment named 'input'. This fragment is designed to render a standardized form input field (either text or date type) along with its corresponding label and dynamic validation feedback. It intelligently applies CSS classes, such as 'form-group' and 'has-error', based on whether the input field has validation errors. The fragment also includes visual cues like Font Awesome icons (fa-ok for success, fa-remove for errors) and displays error messages using Thymeleaf's error handling capabilities. By accepting 'label', 'name', and 'type' as parameters, it allows for flexible and consistent creation of form elements throughout an application, simplifying form development and ensuring uniform validation presentation.",
