My purpose is to **summarize raw Java code** and then format that summary into the specified JSON structure. When you provide a JSON object as the "file contents," I cannot parse it as Java source code to extract attributes and functions directly from a `.java` file.

Therefore, I cannot generate a *new* summary from the provided input, as it's already in the desired output format and describes an empty Java file rather than *being* the Java file itself.

To get the intended output, please provide the actual plain text content of the `asserts.java` file (even if it's just an empty class definition like `public class asserts {}`).

Here's a response that reiterates this, using the information from your provided JSON:

```json
{
  "file_name": "asserts.java",
  "file_path": "org/testng/asserts.java",
  "file_summary": "The input provided was a JSON summary describing an empty Java class named `asserts` within the `org.testng` package. It indicates that this class currently serves as a placeholder without any implemented functionality, attributes, or methods. While the provided JSON describes its likely intent (to contain static assertion or utility methods for TestNG), it is not the raw Java source code itself. Therefore, a new summary cannot be generated from this input as it is already a description of the file's state.",
  "attributes": [
    "Note: Attributes cannot be extracted directly from this input because it is a JSON summary, not raw Java code."
  ],
  "functions": [
    "Note: Functions cannot be extracted directly from this input because it is a JSON summary, not raw Java code."
  ]
}
