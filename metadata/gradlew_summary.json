  "file_summary": "This script is a Windows batch file designed to bootstrap and execute the Gradle build automation tool. It handles the initial setup, including locating a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) either through the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable or by searching the system's PATH. The script defines default JVM options (`-Xmx64m`, `-Xms64m`) and allows for additional options via `JAVA_OPTS` and `GRADLE_OPTS`. It resolves the application's home directory (`APP_HOME`) and then executes the `gradle-wrapper.jar` using the determined Java executable. The script includes robust error handling for cases where Java is not found or `JAVA_HOME` is incorrectly configured, providing informative messages to the user and managing the exit code to ensure proper signaling of success or failure.",
