  "file_summary": "This is a Windows batch script (`.bat`) designed to bootstrap and launch the Gradle build automation tool. Its primary purpose is to locate a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) required by Gradle, first by checking the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, and if not set, by searching the system's PATH. The script sets default JVM options, such as initial and maximum heap sizes (`-Xmx64m`, `-Xms64m`), which can be customized via `JAVA_OPTS` or `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variables. Once Java is successfully located, it constructs and executes the command to run the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file, which is responsible for downloading and running the specified Gradle version. The script efficiently handles command-line arguments passed to it, forwarding them to the Gradle application. It also includes robust error handling to inform the user if Java is not found or if `JAVA_HOME` is incorrectly configured, providing clear instructions for resolution. It manages script-local variables and sets appropriate exit codes.",
