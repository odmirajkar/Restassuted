  "file_summary": "This HTML file, rendered using Thymeleaf, is responsible for displaying a list of veterinarians along with their specialties. It includes a table that iterates through a collection of 'Vet' objects, showing each veterinarian's full name and their associated specialties. If a vet has no specialties, it explicitly states 'none'. The file also implements basic pagination, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of veterinarians if the total number of vets exceeds a single page. Navigation controls for first, previous, next, and last pages are provided, indicating the current page within the total available pages. The layout of this page is inherited from a common 'layout' fragment, ensuring a consistent user interface.",
