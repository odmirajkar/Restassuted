  "file_summary": "This HTML file serves as a Thymeleaf template designed to display a comprehensive list of veterinarians within a web application. It integrates with a common layout fragment (`fragments/layout :: layout`) to ensure consistent page structure. The primary purpose of this page is to present each veterinarian's full name (first and last) along with their associated medical specialties. If a veterinarian does not have any specialties assigned, the template gracefully handles this by displaying a 'none' indicator. Furthermore, the file incorporates robust pagination functionality, allowing users to navigate through potentially large lists of veterinarians. It dynamically generates navigation links for individual pages, as well as 'first,' 'previous,' 'next,' and 'last' page options, all based on the `currentPage` and `totalPages` variables passed to the template. This ensures a user-friendly experience for viewing veterinarian data.",
