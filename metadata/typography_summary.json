  "file_summary": "This CSS file is responsible for defining the foundational typography and font declarations for a web application. It starts by importing two custom font families, 'varela_roundregular' and 'montserratregular', using the `@font-face` rule. For each font, it specifies multiple source URLs with different formats (EOT, WOFF, TTF, SVG) to ensure broad browser compatibility. After font definitions, the file establishes a baseline styling for common HTML elements such as `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, and `input`, by resetting their margins to zero and setting a default font weight and color. Subsequently, it applies specific typographic styles to headlines (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) and strong text, assigning the 'montserratregular' font for a distinctive look and 'varela_roundregular' as the primary font for body text. The file sets font sizes, line heights, and specific font weights for these elements, ensuring a consistent and aesthetically pleasing textual appearance across the website.",
