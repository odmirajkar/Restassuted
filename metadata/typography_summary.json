  "file_summary": "This CSS file is dedicated to defining the typography and font styles for a web application. Its primary function is to embed two custom fonts, 'varela_roundregular' and 'montserratregular', by specifying their source URLs for various browser formats (EOT, WOFF, TTF, SVG). After defining these custom fonts, the file applies a base font family of 'varela_roundregular' along with a default font weight and color to common HTML elements such as `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, and `input`. More specifically, it assigns 'montserratregular' to `h1`, `h2`, and `strong` elements, while also setting distinct font sizes, line heights, and font weights for different heading levels. The `p` (paragraph) element's font size and line height are commented out, suggesting they might inherit values or be defined elsewhere. Overall, this file ensures a consistent and branded typographic appearance across the application.",
