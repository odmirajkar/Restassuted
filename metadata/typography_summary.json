  "file_summary": "This CSS file is responsible for defining the typography of a web application. It starts by declaring two custom web fonts, 'varela_roundregular' and 'montserratregular', using `@font-face` rules. For each font, it specifies multiple source URLs (EOT, WOFF, TTF, SVG) to ensure broad browser compatibility. After importing the fonts, the stylesheet applies global typographic styles to common HTML elements. It resets default margins and sets a base font-family ('varela_roundregular'), font-weight, and color for `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, and `input` elements. Subsequently, it overrides specific properties for headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) and `strong` tags, applying 'montserratregular' for `h1`, `h2`, and `strong`, and defining distinct font sizes, line heights, and margins for a structured visual hierarchy. The `p` tag has commented-out font-size and line-height properties, suggesting they might be defined elsewhere or were previously considered."
