  "file_summary": "This CSS file is primarily responsible for defining and applying custom typography styles across a web application. It starts by importing two custom fonts, 'varela_roundregular' and 'montserratregular', ensuring cross-browser compatibility by providing multiple font formats (EOT, WOFF, TTF, SVG). After defining the `@font-face` rules, it sets the base font styles for common HTML elements such as `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, and `input`. The file assigns 'varela_roundregular' as the default font for most text and inputs, while using 'montserratregular' for headings (`h1`, `h2`) and strong text, giving the site a distinct typographic hierarchy. It also specifies default font weights, sizes, line heights, and a dark text color (`#34302d`) for these elements, establishing a consistent visual presentation for text content.",
