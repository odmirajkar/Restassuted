  "file_summary": "This Java file contains a JUnit 5 test class named `CrashControllerTests`, which is designed to test the functionality of the `CrashController`. The primary purpose of this test is to verify that the `triggerException()` method within the `CrashController` correctly throws a `RuntimeException`. It specifically asserts that the thrown exception's message contains a predefined string, ensuring that the controller behaves as expected when an exception is deliberately triggered to showcase error handling. This test uses AssertJ for fluent assertion syntax.",
