  "file_summary": "This Java test class, `CrashControllerTests`, is designed to verify the error-handling functionality of the `CrashController`. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the `triggerException()` method within the `CrashController` correctly throws a `RuntimeException` with a specific expected message. This helps in testing the application's behavior when an unexpected error occurs, providing a controlled environment to confirm that the exception mechanism works as intended. It utilizes JUnit 5 for testing and AssertJ for fluent assertion syntax.",
