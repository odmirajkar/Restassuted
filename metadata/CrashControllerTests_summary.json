  "file_summary": "This Java file, `CrashControllerTests.java`, contains a simple unit test for the `CrashController` class in the Spring PetClinic application. Its primary purpose is to verify the behavior of the `triggerException()` method within `CrashController`. The test specifically asserts that calling `triggerException()` indeed throws a `RuntimeException` and that the exception's message contains the expected string, indicating that the controller is functioning as designed to showcase exception handling. This test ensures the basic functionality of the 'crash' endpoint without involving a full Spring Boot application context.",
