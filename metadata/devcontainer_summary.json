"file summary":"This JSON file serves as a `devcontainer.json` configuration, defining a standardized and reproducible development environment for Java projects. It specifies `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu` as the base image. The configuration includes several key features essential for a modern development workflow: it installs Oracle JDK version 21, provides the Azure CLI for cloud interactions, integrates Docker-in-Docker capabilities, and includes the GitHub CLI for streamlined Git operations. Furthermore, the file customizes the VS Code experience within the container by recommending crucial extensions for Java development, such as 'redhat.vscode-xml' for XML support, 'visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode' for AI-assisted coding, and the comprehensive 'vscjava.vscode-java-pack'. The `remoteUser` is set to 'vscode', ensuring consistency in user context within the container. This setup aims to provide developers with a complete, pre-configured environment, reducing setup time and ensuring all team members work with identical toolchains and dependencies.",
