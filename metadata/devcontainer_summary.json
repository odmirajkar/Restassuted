  "file_summary": "This JSON file defines the configuration for a Dev Container, specifically tailored to provide a comprehensive Java development environment. It sets 'Java' as its name and uses `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu` as the base Docker image. The configuration integrates several key features: it installs Oracle JDK version 21 via `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/java:1`, includes `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1` for Azure command-line tools, `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2` for nested Docker functionality, and `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1` for GitHub CLI access. \n\nAdditionally, the file customizes the Visual Studio Code experience within the container by specifying essential extensions for Java development. These include \"redhat.vscode-xml\" for XML support, \"visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode\" for AI-assisted coding, and \"vscjava.vscode-java-pack,\" which is a collection of popular Java extensions. The `remoteUser` is configured as \"vscode,\" indicating the user context within the container. This setup ensures a consistent, pre-configured, and fully-equipped environment for Java developers, minimizing setup time and ensuring project consistency.",
