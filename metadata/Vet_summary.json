  "file_summary": "The `Vet` class is a core domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, representing a veterinarian. It extends the `Person` class, inheriting basic personal details such as first and last names. This class is designed as a JPA entity, mapped to the 'vets' table in the database, enabling ORM capabilities for persistence.\n\nA key feature of the `Vet` class is its ability to associate with multiple `Specialty` objects, defining the areas of expertise for each veterinarian. This relationship is managed through a many-to-many mapping (`@ManyToMany`) to the `vet_specialties` join table. The class provides methods to access these specialties, retrieve their count, and add new specialties. Notably, the `getSpecialties()` method ensures that the list of specialties is returned in a sorted order by their name, enhancing data presentation. This design effectively models the real-world concept of a vet and their professional qualifications within the application.",
