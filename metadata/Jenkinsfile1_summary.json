  "file_summary": "This Jenkinsfile defines a declarative pipeline with a single stage named 'git checkout'. The primary purpose of this pipeline is to automate the building and initial execution of a Docker image for a REST Assured testing application. It starts by echoing messages and listing directory contents, then performs a Source Code Management (SCM) checkout to retrieve the project's code. Subsequently, it builds a Docker image tagged as 'restassured-demo' using the current Jenkins BUILD_ID. After successful image creation, the pipeline attempts to run the newly built Docker container. It then captures the container ID of the running 'restassured-demo' instance by parsing the `docker ps -a` output, storing it in a file, and reading it into a variable. Finally, it echoes the captured container ID and lists all Docker images, serving as a verification step for the Docker environment and the application's deployment readiness.",
