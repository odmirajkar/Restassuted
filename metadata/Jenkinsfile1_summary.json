  "file_summary": "This Jenkins Pipeline script snippet defines a single stage named 'git checkout', which focuses on source code management and Docker operations. The pipeline begins by echoing a message \"RESt Assured testing\" and listing directory contents. It then performs a `checkout scm` operation, pulling the source code from the configured SCM (Source Code Management) system. Following the checkout, it lists the directory contents again and displays existing Docker images. The core logic involves building a new Docker image tagged `restassured-demo` with the current Jenkins `BUILD_ID`. It then runs a container from this newly built image. Subsequently, it captures the Container ID of the launched `restassured-demo` container by parsing `docker ps -a` output and saves it to a file, then reads and echoes this ID. The snippet concludes by listing Docker images once more and printing \"pull req test\", indicating a possible focus on pull request testing workflows.",
