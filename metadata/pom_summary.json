  "file_summary": "This is a Maven Project Object Model (POM) file for the 'spring-petclinic' Spring Boot application. It inherits configurations from the 'spring-boot-starter-parent' and defines crucial project metadata such as its groupId ('org.springframework.samples'), artifactId ('spring-petclinic'), and version ('3.5.0-SNAPSHOT'). The file specifies various project properties, including the required Java version (17), character encoding, and versions for third-party libraries and build tools. It meticulously lists all project dependencies, categorizing them into Spring Boot starters (e.g., web, data-jpa, validation, thymeleaf, actuator, cache), database connectors (H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL), caching libraries (Caffeine), and webjars (Bootstrap, Font Awesome). The build section is comprehensive, configuring a suite of Maven plugins essential for code quality, compilation, testing, and packaging. These plugins include `maven-enforcer-plugin` (for Java version enforcement), `spring-javaformat-maven-plugin` (for code formatting), `maven-checkstyle-plugin` (for static code analysis), `jacoco-maven-plugin` (for code coverage), and `spring-boot-maven-plugin` (for creating executable JARs and build info). Additionally, it defines Maven repositories, plugin repositories, and two build profiles: 'css' for compiling SCSS assets and 'm2e' for specific Eclipse (m2e) integration settings. Overall, this POM orchestrates the entire build lifecycle, dependency management, and quality assurance for the 'spring-petclinic' application.",
