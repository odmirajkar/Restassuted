  "file_summary": "This Kubernetes YAML configuration file defines the deployment and exposure of a Spring PetClinic application within a Kubernetes cluster. It consists of two main resources: a Service and a Deployment.\n\nThe `Service` resource, named `petclinic`, is configured as a `NodePort` service. This type of service makes the application accessible from outside the cluster via a static port on each node. It exposes port 80 externally and maps it to targetPort 8080, which is where the application listens. The service directs traffic to pods labeled with `app: petclinic`.\n\nThe `Deployment` resource, also named `petclinic`, manages the lifecycle of the PetClinic application pods. It specifies a single replica (`replicas: 1`) and uses the `dsyer/petclinic` Docker image. The deployment configures environment variables essential for the application: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` is set to `postgres` to ensure the application connects to a PostgreSQL database, and `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` is set to `/bindings` for service binding. It also includes a `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` for management health endpoints. The application exposes port 8080 and defines `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` using HTTP GET requests to `/livez` and `/readyz` respectively, ensuring the application's health and readiness are monitored. Crucially, it sets up a `volumeMount` at `/bindings/secret` which projects data from the `demo-db` secret, enabling the application to securely access database connection details without hardcoding them.",
