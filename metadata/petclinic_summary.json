  "file_summary": "This SCSS file serves as a central stylesheet for a web application, incorporating and customizing the Bootstrap framework with a specific branding theme. It starts by importing Bootstrap and defining a custom `$icon-font-path`. The core of the file lies in its comprehensive set of color variables, such as `$spring-green`, `$spring-brown`, and various shades of grey, which are then used to override Bootstrap's default values for elements like body background, text, link colors, and especially the navbar components. \n\nThe file also customizes radius values and styles for navigation tabs, pagination, and tables, ensuring a consistent look. Beyond global overrides, it includes specific styles for `table` headers, `table-filter` sections, `nav` links, and primary buttons (`.btn-primary`), applying custom colors and hover effects. It defines styles for layout components like `.xd-container`, typography elements such as `h1` and `code`, and specific UI patterns like modals (`#job-params-modal`), `ng-cloak` directives for Angular, and error pages. Additionally, it styles a custom spinner animation and imports other SCSS partials for typography, header, and responsiveness, indicating a modular approach to styling.",
