  "file_summary": "This Kubernetes YAML file defines the necessary infrastructure for deploying and exposing a 'petclinic' application. It consists of two main parts: a Kubernetes Service and a Kubernetes Deployment. The Service, named 'petclinic' and of type 'NodePort', exposes the application externally on port 80, routing traffic to the container's port 8080, making the application accessible from outside the cluster. The Deployment, also named 'petclinic', is responsible for managing a single replica of the `dsyer/petclinic` Docker image. It configures environment variables, notably `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` to 'postgres' for database connectivity and `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` for service binding. Health checks are implemented via HTTP liveness and readiness probes targeting `/livez` and `/readyz` endpoints. Crucially, the deployment mounts a projected volume from a Kubernetes secret named 'demo-db' into the container at `/bindings/secret`, which is typically used for securely injecting database credentials following the Service Binding Specification. This setup ensures the PetClinic application is deployed, properly configured to connect to its database, is discoverable, and its health is continuously monitored.",
