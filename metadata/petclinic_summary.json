  "file_summary": "This SCSS (Sass) file serves as the main stylesheet for a web application, establishing a consistent visual theme. It begins by importing the Bootstrap framework and then extensively customizes its default variables, defining a specific color palette using 'spring' themed colors (green, brown, grey). These variables influence elements like background, text, link, and navigation bar colors, as well as border radii. The file includes a wide range of custom CSS rules targeting common UI components and application-specific elements. This includes styling for tables (headers, filters), primary buttons (with hover effects), various navigation elements, modals (e.g., `#job-params-modal`), error pages, and custom containers like `.xd-container` and `.cluster-view`. It also incorporates specialized styling for Angular `ng-cloak` directives, a spinner animation, and general typography adjustments. Finally, it imports additional SCSS partials (`typography.scss`, `header.scss`, `responsive.scss`), indicating a modular approach to styling. Its primary purpose is to define the overall look and feel, ensuring brand consistency across the user interface.",
