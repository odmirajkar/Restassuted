  "file_summary": "This Kubernetes manifest defines the necessary components to deploy and expose the PetClinic application within a Kubernetes cluster. It consists of two primary resources:\n\n1.  **Service (petclinic):** This resource creates a `NodePort` service, making the PetClinic application accessible from outside the cluster. It maps external traffic on port 80 to the application's internal port 8080. The service selects pods labeled with `app: petclinic`.\n\n2.  **Deployment (petclinic):** This resource manages the deployment of a single replica of the `dsyer/petclinic` application. It sets several environment variables crucial for the application's operation:\n    *   `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: set to `postgres` to enable PostgreSQL profile.\n    *   `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT`: configured to `/bindings` for Spring Cloud Bindings.\n    *   `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`: enables additional health probe paths.\n    It defines liveness and readiness probes pointing to `/livez` and `/readyz` endpoints respectively, ensuring the application's health. Crucially, it mounts a projected volume named `binding` which sources the `demo-db` secret, enabling the PetClinic application to automatically bind to the PostgreSQL database defined by that secret.",
