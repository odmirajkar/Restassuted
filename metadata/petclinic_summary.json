  "file_summary": "This CSS file appears to be a compiled stylesheet, likely from a web project like Spring Petclinic, incorporating Bootstrap v5.3.6. It defines a comprehensive set of CSS variables (`:root` and `[data-bs-theme='light']`, `[data-bs-theme='dark']`) for colors, fonts, borders, and other design tokens, enabling light and dark theme support. Following the variable definitions, it includes a wide array of CSS rules for basic HTML elements (body, headings, lists, tables, forms, buttons, etc.), Bootstrap components (containers, grid system, navigation, cards, alerts, modals, tooltips, carousels, spinners, offcanvas), and utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and visual effects. Additionally, it contains custom styles specific to the 'Petclinic' application, such as table headers, button styling, and layout adjustments for various sections of the application, overriding or extending the default Bootstrap styles.",
