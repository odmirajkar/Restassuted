  "file_summary": "This CSS file provides the styling for a web application, likely a Spring PetClinic application, leveraging and extending Bootstrap 5.3.6. It defines a comprehensive set of CSS variables for colors, typography, spacing, borders, shadows, and other design tokens, supporting both light and dark themes. The file includes base styling for HTML elements like `body`, `hr`, headings (h1-h6), paragraphs, lists, links, and forms. It also incorporates a wide range of Bootstrap components such as grid systems (containers, rows, columns), tables, form controls (inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios, ranges, floating labels), buttons (various styles and sizes), navigation elements (nav, tabs, pills, navbar), cards, accordions, breadcrumbs, pagination, badges, alerts, progress bars, list groups, toasts, modals, tooltips, popovers, carousels, spinners, and offcanvas components. Furthermore, it defines utility classes for layout (display, flex, position, spacing, sizing, overflow), text formatting (font, alignment, decoration, transform, color), background colors, user interaction, rounded corners, and visibility. The latter part of the file contains custom styles specific to the 'petclinic' application, overriding or adding to Bootstrap's default styles for elements like table headers, button colors, navbar appearance, font definitions (varela_roundregular, montserratregular), and specific page elements like the logo, splash screen, error page, and cluster view components, giving the application a distinct visual identity.",
