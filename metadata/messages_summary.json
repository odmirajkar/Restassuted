  "file summary": "This file is a `.properties` file, commonly used in Java applications, particularly Spring-based ones like PetClinic, for externalizing user interface text, messages, and labels. Its primary purpose is to centralize translatable strings and application messages, facilitating internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n). The file contains key-value pairs where keys are identifiers and values are the corresponding display strings. The content covers various aspects of the PetClinic application's user interface. It includes general welcome and error messages such as \"Welcome\", \"Error\", and \"Something happened...\". It defines labels for common entities and their attributes like \"Owner\", \"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Address\", \"Telephone\", \"Pet\", \"Birth Date\", and \"Type\". Navigation labels and action buttons are also present, including \"Add Owner\", \"Find Owner\", \"Edit Owner\", \"Add New Pet\", \"Add Visit\", and \"Edit Pet\". Furthermore, the file provides a comprehensive set of validation messages for form inputs, such as \"required\", \"notFound\", \"duplicate\", \"nonNumeric\", \"typeMismatch.date\", and specific ones like \"telephone.invalid\" for telephone number validation. It also includes labels for organizational elements like \"owners\", \"vets\", \"pets\", and \"specialties\", along with pagination labels like \"first\", \"next\", \"previous\", and \"last\". This file acts as a central repository for all static textual content displayed to the user, making the application's text easily manageable and modifiable without code changes."
