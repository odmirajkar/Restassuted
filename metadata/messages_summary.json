  "file_summary": "This file serves as a localization or resource bundle, typically named `messages.properties` in Spring applications like PetClinic. It contains a comprehensive collection of key-value pairs, where each key represents a specific UI element or message, and its corresponding value is the display text. The entries cover a wide range of application components, including form field labels (e.g., `firstName`, `address`, `birthDate`), button and link texts (e.g., `addOwner`, `findOwner`, `editPet`), page titles (e.g., `owners`, `vets`, `petsAndVisits`), and various validation or error messages (e.g., `required`, `notFound`, `typeMismatch.date`, `telephone.invalid`, `duplicateFormSubmission`). Its primary purpose is to centralize all user-facing strings, facilitating easy modification, translation, and consistent text presentation across the entire application's user interface for entities such as Owners, Pets, Visits, and Veterinarians.",
