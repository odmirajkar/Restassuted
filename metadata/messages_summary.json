  "file_summary": "This file contains a collection of key-value pairs, typically used as a resource bundle or localization file in a Java application. It defines various UI labels, error messages, and field names. The content strongly suggests it's part of a 'PetClinic' application, providing text for user interface elements such as 'Welcome', 'Owners', 'Pets', 'Veterinarians', 'Add Owner', 'Find Owners', 'Edit Pet', and common validation messages like 'required', 'notFound', 'duplicate', and 'typeMismatch.date'. It helps in centralizing and managing textual content, often for internationalization (i18n) or simply for easy modification of display texts without changing source code.",
