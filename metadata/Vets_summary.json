  "file_summary": "This `Vets` class is a simple domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, specifically designed to encapsulate and represent a collection of veterinarian (`Vet`) objects. Its main purpose is to facilitate the marshalling of a list of vets into an XML format, primarily for use with Spring's `MarshallingView`. The class is annotated with `@XmlRootElement`, indicating that it can serve as the root element when converted to XML. It contains a single private list attribute, `vets`, which holds the collection of `Vet` instances. A public getter method, `getVetList()`, is provided to access this list, ensuring it is initialized as an `ArrayList` if it's null, making it robust for data retrieval and XML serialization.",
