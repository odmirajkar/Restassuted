  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the `Vets` class, a simple domain object designed primarily to act as a container for a list of `Vet` objects. Its main purpose is to facilitate XML marshalling, specifically for use with Spring's `MarshallingView` or similar technologies that require a single root element for a collection of objects. By encapsulating a `List<Vet>`, it allows for a cleaner XML representation when exposing a list of veterinarians as part of a RESTful API or web service response. The class ensures that the internal list is initialized upon its first access.",
