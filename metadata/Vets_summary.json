  "file_summary": "This Java class, `Vets`, serves as a simple domain object designed to encapsulate a collection of `Vet` objects. Its primary purpose is to facilitate XML marshalling, particularly for use with Spring's `MarshallingView`. By being annotated with `@XmlRootElement`, instances of this class can be easily converted into XML. The `getVetList()` method, annotated with `@XmlElement`, ensures that the list of veterinarians is properly exposed as an XML element when marshalled. This design pattern allows for a straightforward way to represent and serialize a group of veterinarians into an XML format, making it suitable for RESTful endpoints returning XML.",
