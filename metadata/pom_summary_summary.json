My primary function is to **read raw Java code** and then generate a JSON summary that extracts its Java-specific attributes (fields with types like `private String name;`) and functions (methods with return types and parameters like `public void doSomething(int count);`).

A `pom.xml` file is an XML-based Maven project configuration file. While it defines project properties and dependencies (which you've correctly identified as "attributes" in your provided summary structure for a `pom.xml`), it does not contain Java classes, methods, or member variables in the way a `.java` file does. Therefore, the "attributes" and "functions" sections as defined for Java code (e.g., `data_type` like `String`, `membership_type` like `private static`, or function signatures) are not directly applicable to a `pom.xml` file's content.

Since your input is *already* in the JSON summary format I am designed to output, and it describes a non-Java file type, I cannot process it to generate a *new* summary with Java-specific details.

To get the desired output (a JSON summary of Java code with its attributes and functions), please provide the **raw, plain text content of a `.java` file**.

Here's a response that reflects the situation:

```json
{
  "file_name": "pom.xml",
  "file_path": "/",
  "file_summary": "The provided input was a JSON summary describing a `pom.xml` file. This XML file serves as the Project Object Model for a Maven-based Java project, defining its build configuration, dependencies (e.g., Rest-Assured, JUnit, TestNG, Hamcrest), and compiler settings (Java 1.6). While the provided JSON correctly summarizes its purpose as an API testing project's build definition, it is not raw Java source code. Therefore, specific Java attributes (fields) and functions (methods) cannot be extracted as per the detailed requirements for Java code analysis. The summary accurately notes the file's role in managing dependencies and build lifecycle via Maven plugins like `maven-surefire-plugin` configured for `testng.xml` execution.",
  "attributes": [
    "Note: Attributes and functions cannot be extracted as Java-specific elements (e.g., private fields, public methods with specific signatures) because the provided input is a JSON summary of a `pom.xml` (an XML file), not raw Java code."
  ],
  "functions": [
    "Note: Functions cannot be extracted as Java-specific elements (e.g., private fields, public methods with specific signatures) because the provided input is a JSON summary of a `pom.xml` (an XML file), not raw Java code."
