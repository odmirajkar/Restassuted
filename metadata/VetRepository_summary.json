  "file_summary": "This Java file defines the `VetRepository` interface, which serves as a Spring Data Repository for managing `Vet` domain objects in the PetClinic application. It extends Spring's `Repository` interface, leveraging Spring Data's powerful conventions for query method creation, eliminating the need for explicit implementation. The interface provides methods for retrieving all `Vet` entities, both as a `Collection` and as a paginated `Page`, allowing for efficient data access and handling of large datasets. Crucially, methods are annotated with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to ensure read-only database operations and `@Cacheable(\"vets\")` to enable caching of vet data, improving performance by reducing database hits.",
