  "file_summary": "This file defines the `VetRepository` interface, which acts as a data access layer for `Vet` domain objects within the Spring PetClinic application. It extends Spring Data's `Repository` interface, allowing for automatic query generation based on method names. The primary purpose of this repository is to retrieve veterinarian data. It includes two `findAll` methods: one that returns a `Collection` of all vets and another that returns a `Page` of vets, enabling paginated results. Both methods are marked as read-only transactions (`@Transactional(readOnly = true)`) and utilize Spring's caching mechanism (`@Cacheable(\"vets\")`) to improve performance by caching veterinarian data. This design adheres to Spring Data conventions for simplified data access.",
