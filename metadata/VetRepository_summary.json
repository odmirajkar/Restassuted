  "file_summary": "This Java interface, `VetRepository`, serves as a Spring Data Repository for managing `Vet` domain objects within the PetClinic application. It extends Spring's `Repository` interface, leveraging its convention-over-configuration approach for data access. The primary purpose of this interface is to define methods for retrieving veterinarian data from the persistence layer. It provides two `findAll` methods: one that returns a `Collection` of all vets, and another that supports pagination by returning a `Page` of vets. Both methods are marked with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to ensure read-only database operations and `@Cacheable(\"vets\")` to enable caching of vet data, thereby enhancing application performance by reducing redundant database calls. This design adheres to Spring Data naming conventions, allowing Spring to automatically generate the necessary query implementations.",
