  "file_summary": "This SQL script is designed for initial database setup for the 'Pet Clinic' application. It performs three main operations: first, it creates a new database named `petclinic` if it does not already exist. Second, it alters this `petclinic` database to set its default character set to `utf8` and default collation to `utf8_general_ci`, ensuring proper handling of various characters. Finally, it grants all privileges on the `petclinic` database to a user named `petclinic` with the password `petclinic`, allowing connections from any host (`%`). This script is essential for preparing the MySQL environment before the application can connect and interact with its data.",
