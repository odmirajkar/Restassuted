  "file_summary": "The `Owner` class is a core domain object within the Spring PetClinic application, representing a pet owner. It extends the `Person` class, inheriting basic personal details like first and last name. This class is annotated as a JPA `@Entity` and mapped to the \"owners\" table in the database, facilitating persistence. It encapsulates essential contact information for an owner, including their address, city, and telephone number, all subject to validation constraints like `@NotBlank` and `@Pattern` for the phone number. Crucially, the `Owner` class maintains a one-to-many relationship with `Pet` objects, meaning each owner can have multiple pets. It provides methods to retrieve, add, and search for pets by name or ID. Additionally, it includes functionality to add a `Visit` to a specific pet owned by this owner, ensuring data integrity through assertions. The class also overrides the `toString()` method for comprehensive debugging information.",
