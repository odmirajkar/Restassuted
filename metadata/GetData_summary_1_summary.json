  "file_path": "path/to/unknown_file.txt",
  "file_summary": "The file contains the literal string 'my new file contents'. It is not a Java source file, and therefore no specific Java classes, attributes, or functions can be extracted or analyzed from this content. Its purpose is indeterminate based solely on this string.",
  "attributes": [
    "Note: Attributes cannot be extracted as the provided content is not Java code."
  ],
