  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template responsible for displaying a paginated list of pet owners. It utilizes a `fragments/layout` for consistent page structure and incorporates internationalization for text elements. The core of the page is an HTML table that lists owners with their names, addresses, cities, telephone numbers, and pets. Each owner's name is rendered as a hyperlink, leading to a detailed view for that specific owner. The template dynamically renders the list by iterating over a server-side `listOwners` collection. Crucially, the page includes comprehensive pagination controls, enabling users to navigate through pages of results. These controls display the current page number and provide links to the first, previous, next, and last pages, driven by `totalPages` and `currentPage` variables passed from the backend.",
