  "file_summary": "This HTML file is a Thymeleaf template, commonly used in Spring applications like Spring PetClinic, designed to display a paginated list of all registered owners. It integrates with a shared layout fragment (`fragments/layout`) to maintain a consistent application-wide design, specifically for the 'owners' section. The core of the page is a table (`id=\"owners\"`) that lists key information for each owner, including their full name (which acts as a link to their detailed view), address, city, telephone number, and a comma-separated list of their pets. The data for the owners is iterated from a `listOwners` object provided by the server-side controller. A significant feature of this template is its robust pagination control, which dynamically generates links for navigating through pages of owner results. It displays the current page number, total pages, and provides 'first', 'previous', 'next', and 'last' page navigation buttons. All text labels and table headers are internationalized using Thymeleaf's message expressions (e.g., `#{owners}`, `#{name}`, `#{pages}`).",
